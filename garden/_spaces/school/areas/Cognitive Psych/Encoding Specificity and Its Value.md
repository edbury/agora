# Encoding Specificity and Its Value

## What exactly is encoding specificity?

Encoding specificity
: the notion that past information is easier to retrieve if the retrieval cue provided for that information relates to the encoding of the information

- Mood dependency example
- Note: this effect also suggests that it can be hard to generate information if the information requires a shift in the way information is being processed
  - Example: "the fan effect" - trying to think of the name for the device the circulates air after spending all day cheering for a sports team

## Any interesting findings since?

- Not all encoding and retrieval pairs are of equal value

## Real world applications and research

- Baddelley and Godden's context dependent 1975 experiment
  - Scuba divers in 4 different memory conditions
- Language and memory of event differences
  - Remembering in Tongues (Carpenter, 2000)
- Theories about mood spirals that could relate to disorders
- School-based applications

## So what can I take from this?

- You should really consider the factors around your encoding of past information if you are attempting to recall that information and are struggling to accomplish this
- If remembering a specific piece of information is critical, you can use this concept to increase your chances of recalling that information
- And lastly, when recalling information, you should be aware that your current state is strongly impacting what you are currently able to recall
  - Fight with significant other example
