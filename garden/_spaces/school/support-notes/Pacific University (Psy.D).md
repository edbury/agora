# Clinical PsyD Essay Questions

Recommended answer length: 2-4 paragraphs per essay question

>Describe your clinical experiences and interests. *

Since January, I have been volunteering at Hospice East Bay. The majority of my time there is spent co-facilitating bereavement groups alongside supervising clinicians. In addition to group work, I meet weekly with my supervisors in order to review sessions, client progress, and prepare materials specific to each group.

At HEB, I have worked with as many populations and therapeutic approaches as possible, including those specializing in spousal loss, adolescents, and mindfulness practices. Engaging with clients from different backgrounds has opened my eyes to the diversity of approaches to death and grieving. The experience has also repeatedly reminded me how few options we have in being toward death. Discussing these limitations with my supervisors has further illuminated my need to pursue a higher degree.

>Describe your research experiences (e.g., as a research assistant, any research paper or poster presentations, honors or master's thesis, etc.) and your research interests. *

>Describe the reasoning behind your emphases preferences. Discus how this relates to your goals upon completion of your PsyD in Clinical Psychology. *

>How does the training philosophy and mission of the Pacific University PsyD in Clinical Psychology training program fit with your professional goals and interests?
