# Letters of Recommendation Info

Thank you for serving as a reference. I greatly appreciate that you are taking time out of your busy schedule to support me in this endeavor! Your honesty and insight are important, and your recommendation is greatly valued by the admissions committees. 

## Being a Reference: What to Expect

When I designate you as a reference on my application, you’ll receive an email from the associated school with a link to a recommendation form.  Depending on the school, you will be asked to paste your recommendation into a form or upload a PDF or Word document. Some schools may ask that you answer a handful of Yes/No or multiple choice questions as well.

While the format, content, and length are totally up to you, most schools expect an assessment to address the following:
  
- How long and in what capacity, have you known the applicant?  
- What do you consider the applicant's major strengths as a candidate for graduate studies in clinical work?  
- In what areas/to what degree, does the applicant need to be strengthened as a potential professional clinician? 
- Please discuss any personal knowledge you have of the applicant’s experience in social or clinical service; indicate the nature of experience and your assessment of the applicant's performance, including their ability to respect and work with differences in people (e.g. race, class, culture, and ethnicity).  
- What reservations do you have about the applicant's potential for professional social work? Please tell us whether, in your opinion, the candidate is: highly recommended, recommended, recommended with reservations, not recommended.

Please be sure to complete this recommendation by November 30.
