# The Importance of the Levels of Processing Model

## What is the point of the model?

- Previous research on memory had assumed that each of the memory stages (sensory, STM, LTM) resulted from a series of steps, and that there was no way to bypass or enhance retention of information during those steps.
  - Craik and Lockhart, 1972
- Research on retention of information through different sets of instruction started to bring this idea into question
  - Hyde and Jenkin's 1969 study on retention rates of a) related words, b) words containing e, and c) words that had a number of letters

## So what does the model assume?

- The levels of processing model argues that it is easier to retain information when you are studying it in a particular way (Craik, Tulving, and Lockhart)
  - Structural (shallow) < acoustic (moderate) < semantic (deep)
  - Comes from elaboration (more time and energy spent on information) and distinctiveness (uniqueness to the information)

## Any problems with the model?

- Is this simply more time spent on the information?
  - No - Craik and Tulving's 1975 consonant--two vowel--two consonant experiment
- How do we know information is "deeply" processed? Isn't this a circular definition?
- Is all "deeply" processed information equal?
  - Imprecise vs precise elaboration ("the fat man read the sign that was 2ft high" vs "the fat man read the sign warning about thin ice")

## So why is this so important?

- Are there any moments in your life where you'd really like to retain something without just having to repeat it to yourself over and over and over and over?
- This model suggests this is possible.
- The challenge is to find a way to process information more "deeply"
