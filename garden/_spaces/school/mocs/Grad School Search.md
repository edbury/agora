# Grad school search

I'm currently gathering everything I need to satisfy [[the requirements]].

Most programs expect applications by December 1, so I'll be treating that as my general deadline from here on.

## Program selection

Here's how I narrowed down my options:

- [[total available programs]] - Largest possible scope w/ relevant info attached
- [[minimum viable programs]] - Noncompensatory eliminations based on location and input from [[Fleitas]]
- [[compatible programs]] - Reduced by orientation, research, and clinic alignment.
- [[programs by the numbers]] - the compatible programs list, quantified
- [[the list]] - the final list of suitable programs
