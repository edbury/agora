# Long-Term Memory

LTM has several significant differences from STM:

1.  The decay rate for information in LTM is much slower than that of STM--possibly interminable, though recalling memories from storage does become more difficult with time.
2.  LTM seems to have an unlimited capacity.
3.  Memories in LTM can be incredibly detailed.

## Accuracy

Despite these benefits, LTM is not infallible. They can be rendered inaccurate in multiple ways at multiple stages. Albeit, we still show overconfidence in the accuracy of our memories.

Two factors affect memory during encoding. First, we cannot wholly process an event or information unless our attention is focused on that event. This is called inattentional blindness. Second, our perceptions of an experience are manipulated based on our expectations of that experience. For example, we may ignore information that does not fit our expectations. This is known as selective perception.

During storage/retention, some information may be subject to decay. 

Memories may also be subject to reconstructive processing. That is, the act of remembering may be affected by other cognitive processes or contexts (e.g., perceptions, semantic memory, or associations).

### Eyewitness testimony

Research on eyewitness recall and identification has shown how many factors influence memory. Encouragement by hypnotists may induce inaccurate memories. Perceptual limitations at the time may make later memories less reliable. Various biases may also affect recall.

A biasing effect could be introduced by distinctive shared features, unintentional cues from others (as with the hypnotist above), or implicit memories that interfere with recall. For an example of the latter, seeing mugshots increases the likelihood of misidentification in a lineup. If one of the lineup members were just seen in a photograph, they would look familiar, but the witness may not recall the context.

## Brain structures

Memory is not a single entity, neither conceptually nor neurologically; many different brain structures support it. 

Explicit memories are held in the hippocampus, in the medial temporal lobe. Implicit memories are more diverse in type/content and relate to multiple structures, including the amygdala, cerebellum, motor cortex, and reflex pathways.

## The Atkinson-Shiffrin model

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model emphasizes interaction between STM and LTM. Specifically, they were interested in how information is transferred from STM into LTM. This transfer from STM to LTM can also be conceptualized as knowledge acquisition or learning.

Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed control processes as strategies that determine how information is processed. They can be deployed to assist in storing information in LTM. These include rehearsal, coding, and imaging. 

Rehearsal is the repetition of information, whether aloud or via subvocalization, to keep it active in STM or transfer it to LTM. Verbal rehearsal is typically considered a form of rote learning because it relies on repetition rather than semantic understanding. Coding uses semantic elaboration to contextualize information alongside other information that is easy to recall, such as a mnemonic acronym. Imaging utilizes visual imagery to remember verbal information, for example, the mind palace.

### The Serial Position Effect

One phenomenon that the Atkinson-Shiffrin model accounts for is the serial position effect. The serial position effect is the tendency to better recall information at the beginning and end of a dataset, with information in the middle of the set being retained less readily. This dataset can be--for example--a list of words, a set of numbers, or whole experiences like movies, books, or events.

The serial position effect can be broken down into two parts. First, the better recall of information at the beginning of the set is known as the primacy effect. Second, the better recall of information at the end of the set is known as the recency effect.

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model proposes that the primacy effect takes place because early information can be rehearsed more often than later, increasing the probability that it has been moved to and retrieved from LTM. The primacy effect can be disrupted in several ways. For example, if rehearsal is prevented, information is less likely to enter into LTM, and the primacy effect is eliminated. Similarly, if all the information is rehearsed equally, early information is no longer privileged, and the primacy effect is eliminated. 

As disruptions of this nature are not atypical, the primacy effect does not guarantee improved recall or acquisition.

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model proposes that the recency effect occurs because late information is still active in STM during recall. As such, the recency effect can be disrupted by performing another task before recall occurs--performing arithmetic, for example.

Because the recency effect causes us to experience high retrieval fluency, we may overestimate how well we will recall the information after a period of decay has occurred. 

Other explanations of the recency effect have been proposed. For example, information in an end position may be more distinctive than information in a middle position.

## Metacognition

The control processes proposed above are forms of metacognition, the selection of strategies for processing information. Regarding memory, these strategies may apply to acquisition (storing information in LTM), retention (maintaining that knowledge), or recalling the information from LTM. The latter are known as retrieval strategies.

The selection of appropriate strategies relies partly on self-reflection and judgment of how well we have learned the information. As noted above, relying solely on our experience can lead to inaccurate strategy assessments--for example, when retrieval fluency is high because the information is still held in STM. In those cases, our learning may feel integrated but is quite temporary. We can bolster strategy selection by relying on theory-based judgments informed by understanding which factors influence acquisition, retention, and recall.

## Memory retrieval

During recall, we first determine whether the information is stored in LTM for retrieval. Then, we determine the appropriate strategy for searching LTM for the information. These strategies include matching against partial information like the sound or spelling of a word or trying to reinstate the context of episodic memory. Spontaneous retrieval, recall without conscious effort, can also occur.

When we determine that information is available for retrieval but cannot recall it, we experience the "tip of the tongue" feeling. This state has been studied both in laboratory and naturalistic settings.

## Testing memory

Direct memory tests require individuals to recall or recognize past events. Recall relates to retrieving information from a set you have been exposed to. Recognition memory relates to identifying whether or not the information was part of that set. These tests evaluate explicit memories.

Indirect memory tests, in contrast, are influenced by the memory of past information/events but do not require the subject to recall or recognize that past information. For example, seeing the word "banana" on a list would prime the individual for decoding the word "banana" during a perceptual task afterward. These tests evaluate implicit memories.

### Process theories

Process theories attribute the differences in results between direct and indirect memory tests to the processes involved. In this theory, direct tests engage conceptually-driven processes that are influenced by strategies deployed by an individual--for example, rehearsal or visualization. In contrast, indirect tests engage data-driven processes influenced by perceptual information in the stimulus itself--for example, familiarity.

These processes are not without overlap. Both kinds of processing influence direct tests like recognition and recall. However, indirect tests like perceptual identification are only influenced by data-driven processes. This means that data-driven processes are more vulnerable to disruption from changes in modality (i.e., visual to audio).

### Multimemory theories

In contrast to process memory theories, multimemory theories propose that direct and indirect tests evaluate different types of memories. Direct tests engage episodic memory--specific events and their contexts. Examples include a list of words you were just read, what you ate for dinner, or what your last visit to the doctor was like. Indirect tests engage semantic and procedural memory. Semantic memory consists of general, encyclopedia-style knowledge. For example, Joe Biden is president, a rat is a mammal, and there are seven days in a week. 

While episodic and semantic memory primarily involve factual information, procedural memory consists of memory for actions, skills, and operations. Examples here include conditioned emotional responses and motor skills riding a bike.

Multimemory and process theories do not necessarily imply or require that the other is incorrect; they can be (and are) used in conjunction.
