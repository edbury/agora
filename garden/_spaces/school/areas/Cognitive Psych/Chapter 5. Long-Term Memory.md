# Chapter 5. Long-Term Memory

With one singular exception, time’s arrow is straight. Unidirectionality of time is one of nature’s most fundamental laws.... The singular exception is provided by the human ability to remember past happenings. When one thinks today about what one did yesterday, time’s arrow is bent into a loop.
—Endel Tulving (2002)

long-term memory
: (LTM) Memory that has no capacity limits and lasts from minutes to an entire lifetime

Recall and recognition tests are both direct tests of memory in which the instructions specifically refer to previously presented material, such as when you take an exam.

In contrast, indirect tests of memory determine whether previously presented material helps people perform better on tasks that do not refer to the previous material, such as identifying degraded words when the words were previously shown.

Patients with memory disorders often do as well as people with normal memories on indirect tests.

## The Atkinson-Shiffrin model

### Transferring information from STM to LTM

Long-term memory has two crucial advantages. First, as we have already seen, the rate of for- getting is much slower for LTM. Some psychologists have even suggested that information is never lost from LTM, although we lose the ability to retrieve it.

Another difference between STM and LTM is that LTM is unlimited in its capacity.

control process 
: A strategy that determines how information is processed

The control processes are strategies that a person uses to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge.

rehearsal 
: Repeating verbal information to keep it active in short-term memory or to transfer it into long-term memory

Rehearsal is the repetition of information—either aloud or silently—over and over until it is learned.

coding 
: Semantic elaboration of information to make it easier to remember

Coding attempts to place the information to be remembered in the context of additional, easily retrievable information, such as a mnemonic phrase or sentence.

imaging 
: Creating visual images to make material easier to remember

Imaging involves creating visual images to remember verbal information.

### Verbal rehearsal and learning

rote learning 
: Learning by repetition rather than through understanding

### Rehearsal and the serial position effect

serial position effect
: The ability to recall words at the beginning and end of a list better than words in the middle of the list

primacy effect 
: The better recall of words at the beginning of a list

recency effect 
: The better recall of words at the end of a list

The relation between the rehearsal and recall curves reveals that the primacy effect can be explained by Atkinson and Shiffrin’s theory. Because early words were rehearsed more often than the other words, they should have a higher probability of being retrieved from LTM. This explanation implies that the primacy effect should be eliminated if all the words on the list are rehearsed equally often. In fact, when subjects were instructed to rehearse each word equally often by rehearsing only the displayed word, the primacy effect disappeared

The recency effect is often explained by the proposal that the words at the end of the list are still in STM when a person begins the recall.

If the recency effect is caused by retrieving the most recent items from STM, it should be eliminated if a person performs another task before recalling the items.

It is only fair to point out that there have been other explanations of the recency effect, reviewed by Greene (1986). One such explanation is that the recency effect occurs because the positions at the end of the list are more distinctive than those in the middle.

## Metacognition

metacognition 
: The selection of strategies for processing information

knowledge acquisition
: Storage of information in long-term memory

retrieval strategy
: A strategy for recalling information from long-term memory

### Acquisition

Acquiring good acquisition strategies depends on our ability to judge how well we have learned the material. For example, determining which kind of processing is most effective requires that we recognize that we learned more from some strategies than from others.

A potential hurdle is that judgments of learning are often inaccurate if they are made shortly after studying an item because learning may only be temporary. We may be very confident that we have learned some material immediately after studying it, only to discover that we can’t later recall it

Accurate judgments of learning are useful not only for helping us select effective acquisition strategies but also for helping us determine which items need more study to later recall them.

The problem with immediate judgments is that items are still in STM, making it difficult to predict how easy it will be to later retrieve the items.

retrieval fluency 
: The ease with which an item can be recalled

Retrieval fluency—the ease with which an item can be recalled—failed to predict learning because those items that were easy to retrieve during immediate recall were difficult to retrieve dur- ing delayed recall.

### Retention

Judgments based on retrieval fluency are influenced by our experiences. If we test ourselves and can easily retrieve the answer, we believe that we will easily retrieve the answer at some point later in time.

In contrast, theory-based judgments depend on our understanding of how different variables influence learning and retention.

### Retrieval

Glucksberg and McCloskey (1981) proposed that people first conduct a preliminary search of memory to decide whether they have stored any information that is relevant to the question.

After deciding that it is worthwhile to search LTM, you must decide how to conduct the search.

tip of the tongue (TOT)
: A retrieval state in which a person feels he or she knows the information but cannot immediately retrieve it

There are two general experimental methods for studying the TOT state. The laboratory approach requires bringing people into the laboratory and asking them to recall words that might elicit the TOT state. The diary approach requires that people keep detailed records of what happens when faced with memory blocks in their daily lives.

naturalistic study 
: A study of the tip- of-the-tongue state in which people record these events as they occur outside the laboratory

In naturalistic studies of TOTs, subjects carry a diary to document TOT states as they occur.

1. TOTs are reported to occur in daily life about once a week and to increase with age. Most are triggered by the names of personal acquaintances.
2. Words related both to the meaning and the spelling of the target word are retrieved, but spelling predominates. People can guess the first letter approximately 50% of the time.
3. Approximately one-half of the TOT states are resolved within 1 minute.

The finding that the predominant retrieval strategy involves the partial recall of spelling information is consistent across both laboratory and naturalistic studies

Naturally occurring TOTs yield a moderate number (ranging from 17% to 41%) of spontaneous retrievals in which the word suddenly “pops into mind” without a conscious effort to retrieve it. In contrast, spontaneous retrievals seldom occur (5% or less) in laboratory studies. The greater occurrence of spontaneous retrievals in naturalistic studies makes sense because involuntary word retrieval, in general, typically occurs when a person is engaged in relatively automatic activities such as cleaning or doing dishes (Kvavilashvili & Mandler, 2003). In experimental studies of the TOT effect, participants are kept busy searching for particular words so there is little opportunity for spontaneous retrieval.

spontaneous retrieval
: A retrieval that occurs without making a conscious effort to recall information

An emotional question was more likely to cause a TOT state for both the question and following question, suggesting that emotional arousal lasts beyond the specific question

## Improving eyewitness recall and identification

### Improving eyewitness recall

Although there have been many reports of cases in which hypnosis helped witnesses recall additional details about a crime, problems are associated with its use (M. E. Smith, 1983). A major concern is that encouragement by the hypnotist may induce witnesses to report inaccurately.

Another problem with evaluating the effectiveness of hypnosis is that successful recall during hypnosis may not have been caused by the hypnosis.

M. E. Smith (1983) identifies other possible causes, such as repeated testing and the reinstatement of context.

cognitive interview
: The use of cognitively based retrieval techniques to improve recall

### Eyewitness identification

One source of mistake is perceptual limitations

Other sources of error occur from introducing biases into the identification procedure, particularly when the witness had only a brief glimpse of the suspect or saw the suspect under poor conditions

Part of the problem in deciding whether we recognize someone or something is to recall the con- text in which a previous encounter might have occurred

Mandler (1980) gives an example of a per- son who sees a familiar-looking person on a bus but is unsure why the person looks familiar. It is only after a suitable context is recalled—the person works in the supermarket—that recognition seems complete.

A biasing effect can also occur when an innocent person in a lineup shares a distinctive feature (such as a mole, scar, or tattoo) with the suspect

Another example of biasing effects during a lineup is that the investigators’ unintentional cues, such as body language or tone of voice, may reduce the reliability of eyewit- ness identification.

## Indirect tests of memory

direct memory test 
: A test that asks people to recall or recognize past events

explicit memory
: Memory evaluated by direct memory tests

indirect memory test 
: A test that does not explicitly ask about past events but is influenced by memory of past events

implicit memory
: Memory evaluated by indirect memory tests

Recall and recognition tests are called direct memory tests because they refer to a particular event in a person’s past. The directions ask people to recall or recognize events that occurred earlier and are therefore measures of explicit memory.

In contrast, instructions for indirect memory tests refer only to the current task and do not refer to prior events (Richardson-Klavehn & Bjork, 1988).

Indirect tests are therefore measures of implicit memory.

### Processing theories

recognition memory
: Deciding whether an item had previously occurred in a specified context

According to this theory, recognition memory requires both a judgment of familiarity and an attempt to retrieve the context in which the item occurred.

Jacoby and Dallas’s explanation is an example of how direct and indirect measures of memory can be compared on the basis of what processes are required to perform the task. Elaboration of the material through generating the words from anagrams helps people on recall and recognition tests, whereas increasing the familiarity of the material influences performance on recognition-memory and perceptual-identification tasks.

conceptually driven process 
: A process that is influenced by a person’s strategies

data-driven process 
: A process that is influenced by the stimulus material

Conceptually driven processes reflect subject-initiated activities such as elaborating and organizing information. Such processes help people on recall and recognition tests.

Data-driven processes are initiated and guided by the perceptual information in the material, such as its familiarity

However, this distinction is not mutually exclusive. As we have just seen, recognition- memory tests are influenced by both kinds of processing, but data-driven processing is more predominant in indirect tests than in recognition-memory tests. Modality shifts therefore cause greater disruption in indirect tests such as word-fragment identification than in direct tests such as recognition memory (Schacter, 1987).

### Multiple memories

episodic memory
: Memory of specific events, including when and where they occurred

semantic memory
: Memory of general knowledge not associated with a particular context

It is important to recognize, however, that the argument for different memories does not necessarily imply that the argument for differ- ent processes is incorrect. Indeed, a leading proponent of different memory systems has argued that the two approaches are complementary

Episodic memory contains temporally dated recollections of personal experiences.

It provides a record of what people have done; for example, I had chicken for dinner last night, received my PhD in 1970, and saw a particular person’s face as I was looking at mug shots.

Semantic memory contains general knowledge that is not associated with a particular time and context.

For example, I know that a canary is a bird, Chicago is in Illinois, and the sum of 7 and 8 is 15.

According to this distinction, direct memory tests, which require recall or recognition of material that occurred earlier in the experiment, measure episodic memory.

Indirect memory tests, such as word identification or word completion, measure semantic memory.

procedural memory
: Memory for actions, skills, and operations

Procedural memory is memory for actions, skills, and operations, whereas both episodic and semantic memory are concerned with factual information.

In summary, both process theories and multimemory theories offer sug- gestions for how direct tests of memory differ from indirect tests of memory (Roediger, 1990). Direct tests, such as recall and recognition, are conceptually driven and are influenced by subject-initiated strategies that facilitate retrieval, such as actively generating the items during the study phase. In con- trast, indirect tests, such as the word-fragment and initial-letters tests, are data driven. They are influenced by the familiarity of the material, including changes in its modality. Direct tests measure episodic memory in which peo- ple recall information about particular events in their past. Indirect tests mea- sure procedural memory in which people are not instructed to refer back to past events.

### Brain structures

Research by Larry Squire and his colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego supports the idea that memory is not a single entity but consists of several separate entities that depend on different brain systems

priming 
: Facilitation in the detection or recognition of a stimulus by using prior information

Priming refers to facilitation of the ability to detect or identify stimuli by using prior information.

Another type of implicit memory is learned skills and procedures.

Other types of implicit memory are simple classical conditioning and reflex learning.

## Summary

Learning can be represented as the transfer of information from STM to LTM.

The decay rate for information in LTM is slow compared with the rapid decay rate from STM.

Furthermore, LTM does not suffer from a capacity limitation; that is, it is not limited in the amount of information it can store.

One of the findings that their model accounts for is the serial position effect: The better recall of words at the beginning of a list can be explained by their storage in LTM, and the better recall of words at the end of the list can be explained by their storage in STM.

To retrieve information from LTM, we must initially decide whether the information is stored in LTM. The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon occurs when a person knows information is stored in LTM but cannot immediately retrieve it. Strategies for searching LTM include using partial information such as word length or sounds, generating plausible names, and using contextual information associated with a name.

A recognition task differs from a recall task in that it tests judgment of whether an item was previously presented, usually within a specified context.

Process theories attribute this difference to the conceptually driven nature of direct tests and the data-driven nature of indirect tests.

Explicit memory, measured by direct tests, is localized in the hippocampal formation in the medial tempo- ral lobe. Implicit memory, measured by indirect tests, is used for a variety
of tasks (skill learning, priming, conditioning) that are supported by a variety of different brain structures.

## Study Questions

1. Long-term memory (LTM) is what most of us mean when we speak of memory. What do we mean when we say a person has a “good memory”? What are the assumed characteristics of LTM?
2. As you think about your own attempts to learn new material, can you identify different instances in which you have used each of the metacognitive processes discussed in the book?
3. Notice that the task chosen for the study of verbal rehearsal was a “meaningless” task. Why was that desirable?
4. Do the assumptions of the Atkinson-Shiffrin model seem intuitively compelling to you? How well do the data fit the predictions generated by the model—for example, the primacy effect?
5. How can the recency effect be explained? How was the most popular theory tested?
6. Why did the participants in Koriat’s Experiment 1 not show an awareness of retention interval, yet the participants in Experiment 2 made extremely accurate predictions of retention interval? How does this finding support the distinction between experience-based and theory-based predictions?
7. Be sure you understand the specific uses of the term context in studies of recognition and recall. Are recognition and recall differ- ent kinds of memory?
8. Were you surprised by any of the results of the application of recognition theory to eye- witness identification? Would you recom- mend any changes in criminal justice procedures on the basis of these experi- ments? Why or why not?
9. What techniques have been used to test memory indirectly? How do the tasks called for in direct and indirect tests differ?
10. One explanation of the differences shown in performance on direct and indirect tests points to differential processing demands. What sorts of empirical evidence lead to this view?
