# Mental Rotation and Timing

## Reviewing Visual Memory

- As we discussed in the past lecture, visual memory is a powerful form of memory--but also one that is very difficult to study as researchers
- So what studies have really shown us that we are actually interacting with information when accessing visual memories?

## Concrete Evidence for Mental Interaction with Visual Memories

- Revisiting the Koslyn, Ball, and Reiser 1978 map study
  - Distance = time
- Hegarty's 1992 pulley system experiment
  - Imagining movement caused length of system = time
  - No movement imagery caused length of system â‰  time
- Shepard and Metzler's mental transformation research (1971) and Cooper and Shepard's 1973 followup

## The Images from Shepard's Work

- Those 3D Tetris blocks
- Rotation of one object to match another
  - Are they the same shape?
- 3D tests, then 2D test
- Rotation angle = time

## Can We Lose the Ability to Interact with Some Visual Information?

- Hemispatial neglect
  - usually due to damage to the posterior of the right parietal lobe
  - inability to detect and interact with visual information in our left visual field

## What this Implies

- We seem to be able to somehow mentally interact with visual information and visual memories
- But like in the last lecture, there's still much to be solved as to how we do this
- And, there's even more to be solved in reference to how we can identify when we're doing this well or not
