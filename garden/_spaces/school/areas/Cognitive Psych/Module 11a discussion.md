> Describe how you plan on studying for the final. In this description, try to apply the decision making material to your description.

Coincidentally, I've been using this class to experiment with improving my study habits. I hadn't anticipated so much of the content would be relevant, but it has informed and validated my test approach. For example, I'm constructing a digital semantic network (Similar to SemNet) to help create associations in my actual brain and make information retrieval easy when studying. Rather than only creating a study aid, I hope the process helps store knowledge well.

Over the class term, I've collected lecture and reading notes, along with my assignments, in [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/), a personal knowledge manager. Currently, these notes are not refined for long-term use. My highest priority constraint for addressing the problem is time. I have about two weeks to move from these module-based notes to a more integrated semantic network centered on the content.

Over these two weeks, I will review my written notes from each lecture and reading to identify concepts that deserve their own semantic nodes. For example, "Elimination by aspects" and "Conjunctive model" will likely both become individual nodes that are linked to a third node, "Noncompensatory models." Each node is a note that includes critical information about that concept and its relationships. These nodes will also link back to their source note-node (e.g., the lecture notes, reading notes, or written assignments) so that the concepts are also associated within the context of the class structure.

The decision I am currently faced with is what to study. Ideally, I *should* retain a complete understanding of everything covered, but I doubt I have enough time to achieve that. Thankfully, I have a fair amount of experience with test-taking. I can combine that with our previous assignments to help inform any heuristics I'm using to select what I *must* learn. 

First, wrong answers on quizzes and feedback on written assignments allow me to select information I know I may have misunderstood or misremembered during the module. I should spend extra time reviewing this material. Second, the topics of written assignments and the questions in the quizzes are likely indicators of knowledge we will be tested on in the final, regardless of how well I performed at the time. Because past assignments offer an accurate record of past questions, I hope to mitigate my own availability bias. For example, I may misremember the number of questions about hierarchical information if I spent significant time studying that information previously.
