# The Rules of Language

## What is language?

Language
: A collection of symbols/sounds and rules for combining symbols/sounds used to express messages

Language can exist in many forms:
- Auditory (verbal)
- Visual (sign language, gestures)
- Other/Coded (morse code)

The rules for languages are different in each culture:
- French ex: feminine vs masculine
- English ex: stress on syllables vs placement
- Chinese ex: inflection changes meaning

### Defining "rules"

Grammar
: The set of rules within a language that are used to produce a comprehensible message between individuals

Note: as stated before, there are many different grammatical rules
- Information presentation structuring
- Proper inflection
- Proper pauses
  - Listening to a foreign language example ðŸ‘‡

#### Are all pauses equal?

- "The man ran to the photography store before it closed." (10)
- "Sheet old meet you wrestle two more oh." (8)
- "Clohone breck delosh agust orah le port a grole." (9)
  - I guessed 8 - so close!

What this means: understanding the idea of pauses and when they're required is important, but they're not very easy to detect unless you are familiar with other components of the language

### The components of a sentence

- Sentence - The strangers talked to the players.
- Phrases - The strangers / talked to the players
- Words - The / strangers / talked / to / the / players
- Morphemes - The / strang / er / s / talk / ed / to / the / play / er / s
- Phonemes - [i'm too lazy to figure out how to type all these phonetic characters ðŸ˜…]

morphemes
: the smallest unit of meaning in a sentence

phoneme
: the basic sounds of a language

### So just put them in anywhere?

Grammatical rules of structure were originally believed to be very simple

Phrase-structure grammar
: a set of rules for positioning a sentence into its grammatical units

transformational grammar
: a set of rules for transforming a sentence into a related sentence
- "The dog bit the boy"
- "The boy was bit by the dog"

## Prove it!

Brain research on grammar and meaning
- Wernicke's area - linked to good grammar, not meaning
- Broca's area - linked to good meaning, not grammar

Slips of the tongue - common speech errors
- Word exchange errors - "writing a mother to my letter" instead of "writing a letter to my mother"
- Morpheme exchange errors - "slicely thinned" instead of "thinly sliced"
- Phoneme exchange errors - "feventy soar" instead of "seventy four"
