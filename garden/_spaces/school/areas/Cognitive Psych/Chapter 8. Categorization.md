# Categorization

>We begin with what seems to be a paradox. The world of experience of any normal man is composed of a tremendous array of discriminably different objects, events, people, impressions. But were we to utilize fully our capacity for registering the differences in things and to respond to each event encountered as unique, we would soon be overwhelmed by the complexity of our environment. The resolution of this seeming paradox— the existence of discrimination capacities which, if fully used, would make us slaves to the particular—is achieved by man’s capacity to categorize. To categorize is to render discriminably different things equivalent, to group the objects and events around us into classes, and to respond to them in terms of their class membership rather than their uniqueness. —J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow, and G. A. Austin (1956)

Categories consist of objects or events that we have grouped together because we feel they are somehow related.

Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin, in their influential book, A Study of Thinking (1956), listed five benefits of forming categories:
1. Categorizing objects reduces the complexity of the environment.
  1. Scientists have estimated that there are more than 7 million discriminable colors. If we responded to all of these as unique, we could spend our entire lifetime just trying to learn the names of colors.
2. Categorizing is the means by which objects of the world are identified.
3. The third achievement is a consequence of the first two—the establishment of categories reduces the need for constant learning.
  1. We do not have to be taught about novel objects if we can classify them; we can use our knowledge of items in the category to respond to the novel object.
4. Categorizing allows us to decide what constitutes an appropriate action.
  1. A person who eats wild mushrooms must be able to distinguish between poisonous and nonpoisonous varieties. Eating a poisonous variety is clearly not an appropriate action.
5. Categorizing enables us to order and relate classes of objects and events.
  1. The category chair, for example, has high chair as a subordinate class and furniture as a superordinate class. The three categories form a hierarchy in which furniture contains chair as a member and chair contains high chair as a member.

concept identification
: A task that requires deciding whether an item is an example of a concept, where concepts are typically defined by logical rules

One limitation of this approach is that many categories cannot be distinguished on the basis of a simple rule. We can usually distinguish a dog from a cat, but it is questionable whether we use a simple rule to make this distinction.

logical rule 
: A rule based on logical relations, such as conjunctive, disjunctive, conditional, and bi-conditional rules

## Concept Identification

### Discovering rules and attributes

disjunctive rule 
: A rule that uses the logical relation ***or*** to relate stimulus attributes, such as small or square
: “Patterns that are large or a circle are members of the category.”

conjunctive rule 
: A rule that uses the logical relation ***and*** to relate stimulus attributes, such as small and square
: "a pattern has to be small and square to belong to the category"

rule learning 
: A concept identification task in which people are told the relevant attributes (such as small, square) but have to discover the logical rule

Rule-learning tasks allow researchers to study the relative difficulty of different rules, without having to be concerned about learning the relevant attributes

attribute learning 
: A concept identification task in which people are told the logical rule (such as conjunctive) but have to discover the relevant attributes

### Critique of the concept identification paradigm

The predominant criticism of the concept identification paradigm is that real-world categories, such as clothes, tools, and vehicles, are unlike the categories studied in the laboratory.

continuous dimension
: An attribute that can take on any value along a dimension

Colors, for example, vary along a continuum in which red gradually becomes orange, and orange gradually becomes yellow. People might therefore consider a red object and an orange object as more likely to belong to the same category than a red object and a blue object. However, colors are treated as discrete dimensions in a rule-learning task in which red, orange, and blue are attributes that are considered to be equally different from each other.

hierarchically organized
: An organizing strategy in which larger categories are partitioned into smaller categories

Another limitation of the concept identification paradigm is that it assumed that all members of a concept are equally good members.

In contrast, natural categories are not composed of equally good members. If we gave people different variations of the color red, they would agree that some variations were more representative of the color than others (a “good” red versus an “off” red).

Even mathematical categories that can be defined on the basis of rules contain examples that differ in the typicality of their members.
- For example, a rule can be used to determine whether a number is even or odd. People are therefore likely to agree that even numbers can be decided by definition (Malt, 1990). They also agree that it does not make sense to rate even numbers for degree of membership (Armstrong, Gleitman, & Gleitman, 1983). Nonetheless, people rate some even numbers (such as 4) as better examples of even numbers than others (such as 38). The better examples have fewer digits and do not contain any odd numbers.

typicality 
: A measure of how well a category member represents that category

Real-word categories and their examples are often organized according to how we use them, rather than by abstract rules

## Natural categories

### Hierarchical organization of categories

The largest categories are the superordinate categories, such as musical instruments. They contain the basic-level categories (such as drum), which in turn contain the subordinate categories (such as bass drum).

The differentiation of categories can be measured by determining how much the members of a category share attributes with one another but have different attributes than the members of other categories have.

superordinate category
: A large category at the top of a hierarchy, such as furniture, tools, and vehicles

basic-level category 
: An intermediate category in the middle of a hierarchy, such as table, saw, and truck

subordinate category
: A small category at the bottom of a hierarchy, such as lamp table, jigsaw, and pickup truck

Rosch tested her claim that categorization is fastest at the basic level, by asking people to verify the identity of an object at each of the three levels in the hierarchy.
- For example, before being shown a picture of a living-room chair, people given superordinate terms were asked whether the object was a piece of furniture, people given basic terms were asked whether the object was a chair, and people given subordinate terms were asked whether the object was a living-room chair.
- The fastest verification times occurred for the group that verified objects at the basic level
- But Rosch discussed the possibility that experts might be very quick in making subordinate classifications in their area of expertise.
- The results replicated Rosch and her colleagues’ (1976) findings when dog experts classified birds and bird experts classified dogs. Classification was fastest at the basic level. However, the results were different when dog experts classified dogs and bird experts classified birds. Their subordinate-level classifications were as fast as their basic-level classifications. The experts were so good at distinguishing between different kinds of dogs, or different kinds of birds, that they could identify the type of dog, or type of bird, as quickly as they could recognize that the picture was a dog or a bird.

prototype 
: An item that typifies the members in a category and is used to represent the category
: usually defined as the “average” of the pat- terns in the category. It represents the central tendency of the category.

Rosch and her colleagues found that people were not very good at identifying the average shape of two different basic-level objects belonging to the same superordinate category.
- For example, the average shape of a table and a chair together would look like neither a table nor a chair but something in between that would be difficult to identify.

Creation of an average pattern to represent a category is therefore possible at the basic level (and at the subordinate level, where the shapes of objects in the same category are even more similar) but is not possible at the superordinate level.

### Loss of categorical knowledge

semantic dementia
: Progressive deterioration of knowledge about words and objects
: Patients with semantic dementia gradually lose their knowledge about the meaning of words and objects while often retaining other cognitive abilities.

Rogers and Patterson (2007) studied how the severity of this condition influences patients’ ability to match words and pictures at each of the three hierarchical levels proposed by Rosch.

The results show that although basic categories are easier to initially acquire, superordinate categories are easier to retain as semantic dementia worsens.

### Typicality and family resemblances

Psychologists use the term typicality to refer to differences in how well members of a category represent that category.
- For example, people agree that chairs, sofas, and tables are good examples of furniture; cars, trucks, and buses are good examples of vehicles; and oranges, apples, and bananas are good examples of fruit.

Although the rank order may seem fairly obvious to us, it isn’t obvious why the order exists. Rosch and Mervis (1975) hypothesized that good members will share many attributes with other members of the category and few attributes with members of other categories.

family resemblance 
: A measure of how frequently the attributes of a category member are shared by other members of the category

Because a car has wheels as one of its attributes, we would count the vehicles that also have wheels. Because a car has a windshield, we would count the members that have a windshield. The numerical score for each attribute can vary from 1 to 20, depending on how many of the 20 members in Table 8.5 possess that attribute. The family resemblance score for each member is obtained by adding together the numerical scores of all attributes possessed by that member. If 14 members of the category have wheels and 11 have windshields, the family resemblance score would be 25 for a car if it had only those two attributes. The actual score is of course, much higher, because we also have to add the numerical scores for all the other attributes listed for a car.

Although family resemblance scores are useful for predicting the typicality of members in common taxonomic categories like those listed in Table 8.5, they are not useful in predicting typicality for goal-derived categories

goal-derived category 
: A category whose members are selected to satisfy a specified goal
: Goal-derived categories consist of examples that satisfy a goal, such as “make people happy when you give a birthday present.”

According to subjects’ ratings, good examples of birthday presents include clothing, a party, jewelry, dinner, a watch, a cake, and a card. Notice that these examples are dissimilar to one another and do not share many attributes.

The explanation for this finding is that members of goal-derived categories are selected on the basis of some underlying principle, rather than on the basis of shared attributes.
- Thus, when we select weekend activities, we consider events that we enjoy; when we select things we would take from our home during a fire, we consider things that are valuable and irreplaceable, such as children and important papers.

For goal-derived categories, an underlying principle is the extent to which members satisfy the goal. Barsalou (1991) has shown that goal-derived categories are organized around ideals, and the more typical members of the category are those members that best satisfy the goal.
- For the category foods to eat on a weight-loss diet, the ideal number of calories is zero, so the fewer calories a food has, the better it satisfies the goal of losing weight. Those of us who have attempted a weight-loss diet probably realize that we often like to satisfy more than one goal. We may therefore try to select foods that have minimal calories, maximal nutrition, and maximal taste to satisfy the multiple goals of losing weight, staying healthy, and enjoying food.

ideal 
: An attribute value that relates to the goal of a goal-derived category

### Person perception

stereotype 
: An attribute value believed to be representative of social categories

Exaggerating within-group similarity by creating stereotypes might not only result in erroneous assumptions about others but also make it more difficult for people to remember impressions that disconfirm their stereotypes.

The need to distinguish among individuals is particularly important when the categories are created through clinical diagnosis.
- Examples of diagnostic categories include functional psychosis, paranoid schizophrenia, and affective disorder. Attributes associated with each of these categories are used in diagnosis.

Differences in typicality occur because more typical patients have most of the attributes associated with a particular diagnostic category, whereas less typical patients have only some of those attributes

## Categorizing novel patterns

One characteristic is that some category members are more prototypical, or better representatives, of the category than other members. People might therefore create a pattern, or prototype, that they feel is a very good representative of the category and use it to classify other patterns.
- A model based on this strategy is called a prototype model.

Another characteristic of category members is that they share features, or attributes. People might therefore classify a novel pattern by determining how many of its feature values match the feature values of category patterns.
- A model based on this strategy is called a feature frequency model.

Finally, people may simply remember the examples in a category and compare novel patterns to the examples.
- Because the examples are used directly, these kinds of models are called exemplar models.

### Categorization models

#### Nearest neighbor

nearest-neighbor rule
: A classification strategy that selects the category containing an item most similar to the classified item
: The nearest-neighbor rule states that a person should classify a novel pattern by comparing it with all the patterns in each category to find the single category pattern most similar to the novel pattern. The novel pattern is then classified into the category that produces the best match.

The problem with the nearest-neighbor rule is that it requires a person to compare the test pattern with all category patterns but uses only a single pattern (the one most similar to the test pattern) as the basis for decision. If the most similar pattern is not very representative of its category, the decision could easily be wrong.
- For example, a young child who had a Pekingese dog as a pet might classify a long-haired cat as a dog because the cat looks more like the Pekingese than like other cats. The error would occur because, although a Pekingese is a dog, it is not a very good representative of the category.

#### Average distance

average distance rule 
: A classification strategy that selects the category containing items having the greatest average similarity to the classified item
: A better rule, called the average distance rule, states that a person should compare the novel pattern with all the patterns in each category to determine the average similarity between the novel pattern and the patterns in each category. If the average similarity is greater for category 1 patterns, category 1 should be selected; otherwise, category 2 should be selected.

The average distance rule has an advantage over the nearest-neighbor rule in that it uses all category patterns as the basis for the decision instead of only one pattern.

It has the disadvantage that a person must compute average similarity in addition to comparing the novel pattern to all category patterns.

#### Prototype rule

prototype rule 
: A classification strategy that selects the category whose prototype is the most similar to the classified item
: The prototype model proposes that the perceiver creates a prototype to represent each category and classifies a novel pattern by comparing it with the category prototypes, finding which prototype it most closely resembles, and selecting that category.

The prototype rule has the advantage that it doesn’t require many comparisons to classify a pattern. Instead of comparing a novel pattern with every pattern in the category, a person has to compare a novel pattern with only a single pattern in each category—the pattern that is the best representative of that category.

#### Feature frequency

feature frequency rule 
: A classification strategy that selects the category having the most feature matches with the classified item
: The feature frequency rule is concerned with matching features rather than measuring the similarity between patterns.

#### ..

Both the nearest-neighbor and average-distance models are examples of exemplar models because they propose that people compare patterns to the category examples.

One of the limitations of prototype models is that they are difficult to apply to patterns that cannot be represented along continuous dimensions.
- Schematic faces consist of features that vary along continuous dimensions, such as eye separation or mouth height, so it is possible to create an average pattern, or prototype, to represent the category.
- Now imagine a task that requires classifying people into groups based on their age, education, and marital status.

Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth found that a version of the feature frequency model was a good predictor of how participants classified people. The feature frequency model does not care whether a dimension is continuous.

### Evaluation of categorization models

exemplar model 
: A model that proposes that patterns are categorized by comparing their similarity to category examples
: An exemplar theory proposes that people base their decisions on the examples in the category, rather than on information abstracted from the examples such as feature frequencies or a prototype.

The nearest-neighbor and the average-distance model in Table 8.6 are exemplar models because they assume that a test pattern is classified by comparing its similarity to the category examples.

One factor that influences whether people use a prototype or an exemplar classification rule is the amount of practice they have had in learning the category examples.

Smith and Minda (1998) found that early learning results are more consistent with a prototype model because people have learned only the more prototypical patterns in the category.

Eventually, however, they learn to correctly categorize all the examples in the category, which is more consistent with an exemplar model.

Another influential factor is the number of examples in a category. Minda and Smith (2002) argue that exemplar models have been successful in categorization tasks that have only a small number of examples (typically five examples in one category and four in the other). This makes it possible to learn all the examples with enough practice.

Rule-based category learning depends on the frontal cortex and requires working memory and executive attention. Prototype distortion tasks that cannot be solved by rules, such as the schematic faces shown in Figure 8.5, depend more on perceptual learning that uses the visual cortex.

>There is a temptation for theorists to wish to apply their own approach to all conceptual representations. It is however most unlikely that all concepts are defined or represented in the same way. What is needed for the advance of the field is for a principled account to be given of the range of representational powers that people possess, and for a matching up of different kinds of representation with different conceptual domains.

### Theory-based categorization

Murphy and Medin (1985) proposed that the importance of features depends on the role the features play in people’s theories underlying the categories and hypothesized that people emphasize features that provide causal explanations.

Identifying causes there- fore is important in people’s theories of categories. If the cause is missing, people think it is less likely that an item is a member of the category.

Another aspect of theory-based categorization is that we expect the occurrence of combinations of features based on our previous knowledge.
- A device that operates on the surface of water, absorbs spilled oil, and is coated with spongy material is a plausible device. A device that floats in the stratosphere, absorbs spilled oil, and has a shovel seems to have the wrong combination of features.

## Summary

The concept identification paradigm is one approach to the study of categorization. People try to learn a logical rule by forming hypotheses and receiving feedback on positive and negative instances of the concept.
- Rule learning occurs when people know the relevant attributes and therefore only have to learn the rule.
- Attribute learning occurs when people know the rule but have to learn the relevant attributes.

Two theories that assume people use abstracted information to classify novel patterns are the prototype model and the feature frequency model.
- The prototype model proposes that people create patterns that best represent the categories and then classify novel patterns by comparing them with the category prototypes.
- The prototype is usually the central tendency of the category, formed by calculating the average of all patterns in the category.
- By contrast, the feature frequency model proposes that people classify patterns by comparing how frequently their feature values match those of the category patterns and then selecting the category that results in the greatest number of feature matches. 
- The feature frequency theory has been most successful in predicting how people classify patterns consisting of feature values that do not vary continuously along a dimension.

Exemplar theories propose that people remember specific examples rather than abstract information.
- The average-distance model and the nearest neighbor model are examples of exemplar models.
- More recent formulations of exemplar models include the helpful assumption that some features are emphasized more than others when judging the similarity of patterns.
- Exemplar models have been most successful when people have sufficient practice to learn small categories.
