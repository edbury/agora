# Memory Codes

> It is abundantly clear that what determines the level of recall or recognition of a word event is not intention to learn, the amount of effort involved, the difficulty of the orienting task, the amount of time spent making judgments about items, or even the amount of rehearsal the items receive; rather it is the qualitative nature of the task, the kind of operations carried out on the items, that determines retention. - F.I.M Craik and Endel Tulving (1975)

memory code
: the format (physical, phonemic, semantic) of information encoded into memory

A memory code is a representation use to store an item in memory.

Consider what memory codes might be involved if you were learning to associate pairs of words in a paired-associates task. If the words were presented visually, you might form a visual image of the words. You would also probably rehearse the words and create an acoustic (phonemic) code. If the words were meaningful, you might create meaningful associations to help you learn.

auditory-memory span
: the number of items recalled from STM following an auditory presentation of the items

The purpose of the judgment task (often called an orienteering task) is to try to control the kind of memory code formed by requesting that person make decisions about a particular aspect of the word, such as its pronunciation or meaning. We can then examine how well that person can recall the word as a function of the aspect emphasized.

orienting task
: Instructions to focus on a particular aspect (physical, phonemic, semantic) of a stimulus

levels of processing
: a theory that proposes that "deeper" (semantic) levels of processing enhance memory
: proposed by Craik and Lockhard (1972); holds that success in recalling a word depends on the kinds of operations carried out while encoding the word

## The Levels-of-Processing Theory

### Emphasis on Coding Strategies

The sensory store is pre-attentive in the sense that is occurs before perceptual recognition. Attention influences what observers recognize, as when they attend to a particular row of letters after hearing a tone. The sensory store provides a literal copy of the stimulus input but rapidly decays. It isn't possible to use a control process or strategy to maintain the store, so information must be ready out using pattern recognition to preserve it in a more permanent store.

To enter STM, the information must be attended to and described. It can be maintained in STM by continued attendance to it or by use of verbal rehearsal. Because verbal rehearsal is often used, the format is primarily phonemic, but it can also be visual or semantic. STM is limited by its small capacity and fast decay rate, but retrieval is easy because so few items have to be searched.

Information is entered into LTM mainly through verbal rehearsal (well. is it?). LTM is largely semantic; that is, it is organized according to meaning. It has no known limits in capacity, and its contents, if lost at all, are lost through interference. The ability to retrieve information from LTM can last from minutes to years. Cues are very useful in retrieving information from LTM, but retrieval may require a lengthy search and a considerable amount of time.

The levels-of-processing theory proposes that there are different ways to code material and that some memory codes are better than others. Preliminary processing is concerned with the analysis of physical features such as lines, angles, brightness, pitch, and loudness. Later stages of analysis are concerned with pattern recognition and identification of meaning. After the stimulus is recognized, it may be further elaborated--a word, sight, or smell may trigger associations, images, or stories on the basis of the individual's past experience with that particular stimulus. The levels-of-processing theory claims that analysis proceeds through a series of sensory states to levels associated with pattern recognition to semantic-associative states.

Each level of analysis results in a different memory code--but a memory code that varies in its decay rate. The memory code and its persistence are therefore both by-products of perceptual processing. When only the physical features of a stimulus have been analyzed, the memory code is fragile and quickly decays. When the stimulus has been identified and named, the memory code is stronger and can be represented by an intermediate decay rate. Memory is best when a person elaborates the meaning of the stimulus.

### Implications for Verbal Rehearsal

maintenance rehearsal
: Rehearsal that keeps information active in STM

Noice concludes that "actors are expert analyzers, not expert memorizers, and one result of this in-depth analysis is that by struggling to uncover the underlying meaning of each line, the actual words are also retained without much deliberate effort to commit them to memory."

## Supporting Evidence of the Levels-of-Processing Theory

### The Hyde-Jenkins Experiment

incidental learning task
: a task that requires people to make judgments about stimuli without knowing that they will later be tested on their recall of the stimuli
: people are given some material but are not told that they have to learn it. the experimenter then later gives them a recall or recognition test on the items presented during the experiment. in an intentional learning task, by contrast, the subjects are explicitly told to learn the material.

primary associates
: words that are strongly associated with each other, as typically measured by asking people to provide associations to words
: words that are highly associated; for example, the word _red_ is highly associated with the word _green_, and _table_ is highly associated with _chair_

Incidental learning was as effective as intentional learning when students considered the meaning of the words.

clustering
: percentage of occasions in which a word is followed by its primary associate during the free recall of words
: hyde and jenkins defined the percentage of clustering as the number of associated pairs recalled together divided by the total number of words recalled

### Structural, Phonemic, and Semantic Processing

structural coding
: a memory code that emphasizes the physical structure of the stimulus

phonemic coding
: a memory code that emphasizes the pronunciation of the stimulus

semantic coding
: a memory code based on the meaning of the stimulus

Subsequent research, however, shows that levels of processing has little impact on retention in short-term working memory. Varying the level of processing did not affect the recall of words in a short-term working memory span task.

## Criticisms and Modifications of the Theory

### Criticisms

However, the recognition is still much better after semantic process, proving that the level of processing, not the time spent processing, is the best determinant of retention. (two consonant--two vowel-consonant test)

### Elaboration of Memory Codes

One explanation of how memory codes differ proposes that they differ in the number and types of elaborations stored in memory. This view assumes that people store much more than simply the items presented to them--they also store additional associations that help them remember the items. Anderson and Reder have proposed that, although it is very easy to elaborate material at the semantic level, it is difficult to construct elaborations at the structural or phonemic level. Most of our associations are concerned with meaning rather than with the physical structure of letter, spelling, or pronunciation. Anderson and Reder suggest that the reason for this difference is that people usually try to remember the meaning of what they read rather than such details as what the letters looked like. As a consequence, people have learned to elaborate on the semantic content because doing so is generally more useful than elaborating on non-semantic content.

One method for increasing semantic elaboration is to provide a richer, more elaborate context.

noncued recall
: recall that occurs without hints or cues provided by the experimenter

cued recall
: recall that occurs with hints or cues, such as providing the questions asked during the judgment phase of the task

After completing 60 judgments, subjects were asked to recall as many words as they could from the initial phase of the experiment. They were then shown the original sentence frames and asked to recall the word associated with each sentence. The first part of the recall task is called noncued recall, and the second part is called cued recall because students could use the sentence frames as retrieval cues.

The more elaborate code was ineffective, however, if the word did not fit the sentence. This finding suggests that the elaboration must be consistent with the meaning of the word to be effective. Even when elaboration is generally consistent with the meaning of a word, it can vary in effectiveness depending on how precisely it relates to the word's meaning.

imprecise elaboration
: provision or generation of additional material unrelated to remembered material

precise elaboration
: provision or generation of additional material closely related to remembered material

Although both sentences provide additional information, there is an important distinction between the two elaborations. The first is an imprecise elaboration because there is no apparent relation between the adjective fat and the height of the sign. The second is a precise elaboration because the degree of danger of thin ice depends on a personâ€™s weight.

The results show that elaboration is not always effective in recall because imprecise elaboration actually caused a decline in performance relative to the control group. To be effective, the elaboration should clarify the significance or relevance of a concept (such as fat man) relative to the context (thin ice) in which it occurs.

self-generation
: generation of items by participants in an experiment, rather than the provision of these items by the experimenter

Elaboration is particularly effective when it is directed toward understanding the potential relevance of the information presented.

### Distinctiveness of Memory Codes

distinctive item
: an item different in appearance or meaning from other items
: one that really stands out from other items that could interfere with our memory

primary distinctiveness
: an item distinct from other items in the immediate context

Imagine that you are shown a list of common words and all the words are printed in red ink, except for one word that is printed in black ink. Later you are asked to recall the words on the list. Which word do you think you would have the best chance of recalling? The results of past research indicate that you would more likely recall the word in black ink than the words in red ink. Note that the word in black ink is distinctive only because the color differs from the color of other words on the list. In general, a common word in black ink is not particularly distinctive.

Release from proactive interference is an example of improving recall by making items distinct from other items in the immediate context.

secondary distinctiveness
: an item distinct from items stored in LTM
: defined relative to information in our LTM rather than to information in the immediate context--on example is a characteristic of a word's spelling

orthographic distinctiveness
: lowercase words that have an unusual shape
: determined by the sequencing of short and tall letters in a word

Orthographically distinctive words include lymph, khaki, and afghan. Examples of orthographically common words are leaky, kennel, and airway.

Notice that a shape is unusual (distinctive) relative to all other words stored in LTM, not just to words in the immediate context of the experiment.

emotional distinctiveness
: items that produce an intense emotional reaction
: motivated by finding events producing strong emotional responses

flashbulb memory
: a memory of an important even that caused an emotional reaction
: the vivid recollections that most people have of the circumstances surrounding their discovery of a shocking piece of news

Events such as the assassination of President Kennedy or the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger (Winograd & Neisser, 1992) have been studied as examples of peopleâ€™s flashbulb memories.

For emotional events, the quality of memory for a few details may matter; for neutral events, the quantity of contextual details may be more important.

processing distinctiveness
: creation of a memory code that makes that memory distinct from other memories
: depends on how we process the stimulus--it is therefore the result of the memory code that we create for an item rather than the characteristics of the item itself

For example, even if an item is not very distinctive, you may think of a distinctive way of remembering it. If it is distinctive, you may think of a way of processing it to make it even more distinctive.

An example of processing distinctiveness is that people apparently remember faces as caricatures by exaggerating the distinctive features to make the faces even more distinct.

Several psychologists (Moscovitch & Craik, 1976; Eysenck, 1979) have argued that semantic codes result in better retention than do phonemic codes because semantic codes are much more distinctive than phonemic codes. They base their argument on the fact that there is a relatively small number of phonemes; thus, phonemic codes necessarily overlap with each other, whereas the domain of possible meanings is essentially limitless.

The central idea that there are qualitative differences in memory codes, that different orienting tasks can determine which codes are emphasized, and that memory codes differ in their decay rate remains a useful conception of memory.

## Encoding Specificity and Retrieval

### The Encoding Specificity Principle

encoding specificity principle
: a theory that states that the effectiveness of a retrieval cue depends on how well it relates to the initial encoding of an item
: "Specific encoding operations performed on what is perceived determine what is stored, and what is stored determines what retrieval cues are effective in providing access to what is stored" (Tulving and Thomson)

The first part states that memory traces differ not only in their durability but also in the kind of information they contain.

The second part states that the information that memory traces contain determines what kind of retrieval information should facilitate their recovery.

The second part implies that it is possible to hold constant the encoding conditions of an item and still observe large differences in its recall, depending on the retrieval conditions. The encoding and retrieval conditions can interact in the sense that a cue that is effective in one situation may or may not be effective in another.

mood-dependent memory
: memory that is improved when people are tested under conditions that recreate their mood when they learned the material
: hypothesis that we are better able to recall information if our mood during retrieval matches our mood during learning

### Interaction between Encoding and Retrieval Operations

The interaction between encoding and retrieval is illustrated by the fact that the effectiveness of a retrieval cue depends on how a word was coded. When its semantic characteristics were emphasized, a semantic cue was more effective than a phonemic cue. When its phonemic characteristics were emphasized, a phonemic cue was more effective than a semantic cue. In other words, the specific encoding of an item determines which retrieval cues are most effective for gaining access to what is storedâ€”the encoding specificity principle.

### Transfer-Appropriate Processing

transfer-appropriate processing
: encoding material in a manner related to how the material will be used later
: emphasizes that the value of a particular learning strategy is relative to a particular goal
: implies that the effectiveness of learning can only be determined relative to the testing situation

For example, if the test emphasizes phonemic information and you had been concentrating on semantic information, you could be in trouble.

If the test is a multiple-choice test, it is likely that knowledge of details will be more useful than knowledge about the general organization of the material. If the test is an essay test, it is likely that careful organization of the material will be more useful than knowledge of many details.

problem-oriented acquisition
: encoding material in a manner that is helpful for its later use in solving problems

fact-oriented acquisition
: encoding material in a manner that emphasizes factual knowledge without emphasizing its application

How are the two theoretical constructs, encoding specificity and transfer-appropriate processing, similar, and how are they different?

Both constructs are similar in that they emphasize that good performance depends on maximizing the similarity between the encoding and the retrieval of the material. They differ in whether the decision on how to do this is made at the encoding stage or the retrieval stage. In transfer-appropriate processing, the decision is made at the encoding stage. The retrieval conditions, such as a multiple-choice exam or an essay exam, are fixed, and you have to decide how to encode the material to prepare for the type of exam. In encoding specificity, the encoding has already occurred, and the decision requires finding effective retrieval cues to match the encoding. Transfer-appropriate processing therefore looks forward in time, from encoding to retrieval, whereas encoding specificity looks backward in time, from retrieval to encoding.

## Summary

The levels-of-processing theory proposes that how an item is encoded determines how long it can be remembered.

The elaboration hypothesis claims that it is easier to retrieve more elaborate codes and easier to provide associations at the semantic level.

The distinctiveness hypothesis claims that it is easier to retrieve distinctive codes and that semantic codes are more distinctive than phonemic codes.

The encoding specificity principle states that the effectiveness of a retrieval cue is determined by how well it corresponds to the characteristics of the memory trace.

When the memory trace emphasizes semantic characteristics, a semantic cue is the most effective; when the memory trace emphasizes phonemic information, a phonemic cue is most effective.

The best retrieval cue is one that exactly duplicates the original context, and, for the cue to be at all effective, the item should fit the context.

Transfer-appropriate processing suggests that people should create memory codes that will correspond to how they will eventually use the material, such as in a multiple-choice, essay, or problem-solving test.
