Hello, and welcome to Site 17.

We're so glad you've volunteered as a D-Class research subject. In exchange, your capital sentence has been commuted to a thirty-day term with us. That's right, only 720 hours of service, and you're free to go.

Soon, you'll be taken to processing, where our expert staff will insert a state-of-the art monitoring capsule into the base of your neck. This ensures Foundation staff can find and identify you in case of an emergency.

For now, just relax, and remember to comply with all staff instructions.

At Site 17, you're in good hands.
