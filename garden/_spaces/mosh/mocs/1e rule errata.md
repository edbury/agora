# WIP Rules

1. What does Wounds DMG mean? Ignore it, it's getting cut.  
  - The wound damage being removed from the 1E WIP relates to the Boarding Axe, Crowbar, Stun Baton & Unarmed attacks. This additional damage will be removed as it was causing confusion. This removal has no effect on weapons that just deal [x Wound DMG] (Combat Shotgun, Flamethrower, Smart Rifle), and they will likely remain the same - destroying entire Wounds when they deal damage.
2. What if a roll is equal to my Stat Check or Save? It's a failure.
3. How do rolls on the critical tables work with advantage? The result that is best for the person who rolled the critical hit.
4. When seeking Medical Care during Shore Leave (pg. 27), what does "_at the cost of 1 Wound_" mean? - This refers to the Healthcare fee payed to heal wounds. Refer to the Ports table (pg26).
8. Critical hits will likely just do 2x damage instead of “a wound.”
9. HMG stats are: Damage - 3d10+ Crit - gunshot/gore + Shots - 5
