# Expert Categorization

One topic about which I am an expert is existentialist philosophy, particularly from the 19th and early 20th centuries. I studied existentialism in undergrad and grad school, so I am intimately familiar with the core texts. While considering examples for this topic, I noticed that I continued to reach toward those involving subordinate categories.

For example, the novel information might be an unattributed passage of text I've never encountered before. In this case I have direct access to the item, which includes its stylistic and semantic content. One reasonable question about this text would be, "Which existentialist philosopher is the most likely author of the passage?"

For this categorization task, I would likely utilize an exemplar model. Because I'm so familiar with a number of texts, it seems easier to compare features of this new passage with remembered examples than to refer to a constructed abstraction—especially regarding the author's style (e.g., diction, word choice, tone). Specifically, the average distance rule seems like both the most likely and most advantageous approach here. That is, I would select the author whose works have the greatest average similarity to the passage.

Application of the nearest-neighbor rule—comparison against the most alike passage—is technically quicker; however, it's also more error prone. Additionally, it's easy to call to mind multiple example quotations for comparison for most potential authors. In our reading, the distinction between the nearest-neighbor and average distance rules hinges on one vs *all* patterns rather than one vs *many*. In reality, it seems highly unlikely that I am going to compare this novel passage to every stored example of existentialist authors I have available before I come to a confident conclusion about the proper category.

I'll note that my strategy would likely change if the task or item moved "upward" in the categorical hierarchy. For example, someone might describe an unencountered philosopher to me and ask, "Which school of philosophy do they belong to?" This would align closer with basic-level categories, and it feels easier to check against prototypes in this case. That is, I might respond, "That sounds like any Nietzschean," rather than "This reads very similarly to Aphorism 386."

# Novice Categorization

My partner is currently teaching me how to identify different types of plants so that I can help plan and maintain our garden. The goal-oriented nature of this learning does emphasize some features over others, but the categories themselves are not necessarily goal-derived at this point. For example, I pay more attention to how much light a plant requires, but I am not selecting for "plants that will do well against the back well."

I'm new enough to the world of gardening that novel information is most often represented by a new plant. Typically, my partner will bring home a plant, tell me the name, and then I will set to work noting its relevant features. In this case, I am almost always using feature frequency to categorize the item. That is, I categorize each plant by checking each feature and seeing which category has the most matches (e.g., Is it perennial or annual? Where does it fall on the continuum of light needs? Which type of plant has members with the most similar features?). I see two reasons for this. 

First, my familiarity with botanical taxonomies is essentially non-existent. I have very few exemplars to pull, and my general understandings are so limited that forming prototypes doesn't come easily. Instead, it's easier to "checklist" any new plant's features. Second, I am aware that learning *itself* is one of my goals. Engaging with the feature frequency rule involves a more thorough examination of the novel plant as I check against individual features.
