Part 1: Personal Statement

The MSW Program at the University of Washington School of Social Work is grounded in our commitment to racial, economic, gender, and social justice informed by and for those at the social margins of our local, national, and global communities. Reflecting on the UWSSW‚Äôs MSW Program Statement of Purpose, in 2 - 3 pages share:

-   What you hope to do as an MSW;
-   How your unique identities, perspectives, and skills have prepared you to work towards social change across different systems - with individuals, communities, organizations, institutions, and/or at the policy and structural levels - and how this background has influenced your decision to pursue an MSW; and,¬†
-   How you hope an MSW education will support your work towards social justice and development of anti-oppressive practice.¬†

Part 2: Critical Reflection on Anti-Oppressive Practice

Every day we see manifestations of structural oppression. Given our current reality and historical roots we recognize that centering actions to end white supremacy and racism is necessary to achieve equity and justice for all socially marginalized groups. We are seeking students who want to join us in the SSW learning community as we wrestle with complex social problems, and who understand that we must work together to end oppression in all its forms. As such, please critically reflect on the following questions and respond in no more than two (2) pages:

1.  Why does structural oppression exist? How has your understanding of this evolved over time?
2.  Why do you think it‚Äôs important to employ anti-racist practices and principles in social work? Give an example of a structural, institutional, or societal level change that social workers can advocate for that addresses systemic racism and white supremacy.
