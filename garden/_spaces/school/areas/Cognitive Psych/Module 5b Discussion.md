>Knowing that there is such a wide range of uses in these cognitive and memory tests, explain your own personal experience or the experience of someone you know with these tests. Note: please only answer this question if you feel comfortable sharing this information. Do not disclose information you deem too private.

Most of my experience with cognitive or memory tests is limited to in-class demonstrations or non-proctored quizzes like the Mensa IQ Challenge. However, I did undergo clinical assessments twice as a child.

When I was five or six, my mother took me to see a professional for some sort of assessment. I can't remember if the need was explained to me at the time, but it wasn't discussed afterward. The experience is incredibly fuzzy, but I can remember two of the tests. One was a tangram construction task. The other was similar to the game of Memory/Concentration. I had to match like but not identical shapes when turning over cards.

When I was 12, I had to undergo a series of assessments closer to the verbal tests we've been reading about. My sisters and I had undergone a prolonged family trauma, and we were assessed as part of court proceedings. Once again, I don't remember anyone explaining the need to me at the time, but I assume they were trying to establish whether any cognitive or emotional damage had occurred. None of the tests stand out in my memory, but I remember the entire process being anxiety-inducing. I was very worried that someone would discover I was broken or stupid--or that if I performed poorly, someone else might get in trouble. Even recalling it now still leaves a bad taste in my mouth!
