# CSEB Essays

The Personal Statement is an opportunity for applicants to demonstrate strong writing and critical thinking skills. It also allows applicants to describe their interest in social work and their unique experiences and attributes that make them a good fit for the CSUEB MSW program.

The mission statement of the CSUEB MSW program reads:

The mission of the Master of Social Work program is to graduate culturally responsive urban social workers in the areas of Children, Youth, and Families and Community Mental Health. Social work graduates are well prepared to address individual, family, group, and community needs caused by inequalities of class and identity, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, immigration status, religion, caste, and other forms of social injustice.  Advocacy and social change to address these injustices form the core of the MSW program.
  
The MSW Department Application asks you to write a 3 page personal statement. The personal statement helps reviewers learn about you and your MSW goals. Please see the Personal Statement Instructions which outline 3 specific topics.  

When you complete the personal statement, follow these guidelines:

1.  Respond to the prompts. Be sure to respond to the 3 prompts listed in the application.
  
2.  Be honest.  Tell us your strengths. If your application has certain weaknesses, address them. For instance, if your GPA is low, explain why.  
  
3.  Demonstrate college level writing.  Have someone with good editing skills proofread your application. As we read about you, we are also assessing your writing skills, because graduate school and social work require a significant amount of writing.  

5.  Describe aspects of your employment and/or volunteer work that give you experience that is relevant to our program’s mission (see the Mission Statement). 
  
6.  Emphasize any other life experience you have had in areas directly pertinent to your future social work studies and career objectives. 

Demonstrate your understanding of the social work field with attention to social justice issues, why they interest you, and what you hope to do with an MSW.

## Prompts

In no more than three pages, please address each of the three topics below. The statement must be double-spaced, with 1-inch margins, and a 12-point professional font (Arial, Calibri, Times, Verdana, etc.).

For each section, applicants may include examples from personal or work/volunteer experiences that help give a richer answer. You DO NOT need to restate the question; simply label each section with 1, 2, & 3.

1.  Please discuss your reasons for wanting an MSW, your expectations for being a professional social worker, and any particular populations or social issues of interest.
  
2.  Discuss at least two (2) social justice issues (“isms”) you have experienced because of your involvement with and/or membership in a culture with which you identify. Social justice issues often relate to those items listed in our mission statement above, as well as many other experiences that can result in oppression such as health/mental health status, immigration, addiction, poverty/social class, educational access, criminal justice/incarceration, human trafficking, and violence. 
  
3.  Finally, make your “elevator pitch”: what makes you uniquely qualified to be accepted into the CSUEB MSW program?
