      Revolutionary movements do not spread by contamination but by *resonance*. Something that is constituted here resonates with the shock wave emitted by something constituted over there. A body that resonates does so according to its own mode. An insurrection is not like a plague or a forest fire—a linear process which spreads from place to place after an initial spark. It rather takes the shape of a music, whose focal points, though dispersed in time and space, succeed in imposing the rhythm of their own vibrations, always taking on more density. To the point that any return to normal is no longer desirable or even imaginable.

      From whatever angle you approach it, the present offers no way out. This is not the least of its virtues.

      It's the privileged feature of radical circumstances that a rigorous application of logic leads to revolution. It's enough just to say what is before our eyes and not to shrink from the conclusions.

      "I AM WHAT I AM." My body belongs to me. I am me, you are you, and _something's wrong._ [...] The more I want to be me, the more I feel an emptiness. The more I express myself, the more I am drained. The more I run after myself, the more tired I get.

      Our feeling of inconsistency is simply the consequence of this foolish belief in the permanence of the self and of the little care we give to what makes us what we are.

      *The self is not some thing within us that is in a state of crisis; it is the form they mean to stamp on us.*

      From flirtation to divorce, from cohabitation to stepfamilies, everyone feels the inanity of the sad family nucleus, but most seem to believe that it would be sadder still to give it up. The family is no longer so much the suffocation of maternal control or the patriarchy of beatings as it is this infantile abandon to a fuzzy dependency, where everything is familiar, this carefree moment in the face of a world that nobody can deny is breaking down, a world where "becoming self-sufficient" is a euphemism for "finding a boss."

      "Becoming autonomous," could just as easily mean learning to fight in the street, to occupy empty houses, to cease working, to love each other madly, and to shoplift.

      [...] we get down on all fours to climb the ladders of hierarchy, but privately flatter ourselves that we don't really give a shit. We stay at work until ten o'clock in the evening when we're swamped, but we've never had any scruples about stealing office supplies here and there, or carting off inventory in order to resell it later. We hate bosses, but we want to be employed at any cost. To have a job is an honor, yet working is a sign of servility.

      Excuse us if we don't give a fuck.

      We belong to a generation that lives _very well_ in this fiction. That has never counted on either a pension or the right to work, let alone rights _at_ work. That isn't even "precarious," as the most advanced factions of the militant left like to theorize, because to be precarious is still to define oneself in relation to the sphere of work, that is, _to its decomposition_. We accept the necessity of finding money, by whatever means, because it is currently impossible to do without it, but we reject the necessity of working. Besides, we don't work anymore: _we do our time_. Business is not a place where we exist, it's a place we pass through.

      This flexible, undifferentiated workforce that moves from one task to the next and never stays long in a business can no longer even consolidate itself as a force, being outside of the center of the production process and employed to plug the holes of what has not yet been mechanized, as if pulverized in a multitude of interstices. The temp is the figure of the worker who is no longer a worker, who no longer has a _trade_—but only abilities that he sells where he can—and whose very availability is also a kind of work.

      Today work is less tied to the _economic_ necessity of producing goods than to the _political_ necessity of producing producers and consumers, and of preserving by any means necessary the order of work. Producing _oneself_ is becoming the dominant occupation of a society where production no longer has an object[...]

      This swarming little crowd that waits impatiently to be hired while doing whatever it can to seem natural is the result of an attempt to rescue the order of work through an ethos of _mobility_. To be mobilized is to relate to work not as an activity but as a _possibility_. If the unemployed person removes his piercings, goes to the barber and keeps himself busy with "projects," if he really works on his "employability," as they say, it's because this is how he demonstrates his mobility. Mobility is this slight detachment from the self, this minimal disconnection from what constitutes us, this condition of strangeness whereby the self can no be taken up as an object of work, and it now becomes possible to sell _oneself_ rather than one's labor power, to be remunerated not for what one does but for what one is, for our exquisite mastery of social codes, for our relational talents, for our smile and our way of presenting ourselves. This is the new standard of socialization. Mobility brings about a fusion of the two contradictory poles of work: here we participate in our own exploitation, and all participation is exploited. Ideally, you are yourself a little business, your own boss, your own product.

      "Never could I have imagined anything so beautiful. It's superb. I won't deny that the people of the COmmune are frightful rogues. But what artists! And they were not even aware of their own masterpiece! [...] I have seen the ruins of Amalfi bathed in the azure swells of the Mediterranean, and the ruins of the Tung-hoor temples in Punjab. I've seen Rome and many other things. But nothing can compare to what I feasted my eyes on tonight."

      It is precisely due to this architecture of flows that the metropolis is one of the most vulnerable human arrangements that has ever existed. A brutal shutting down of borders to fend off a raging epidemic, a sudden interruption of supply lines, organized blockades of the axes of communication—and the whole facade crumbles, a facade that can no longer mask the scenes of carnage haunting it from morning to night. The world would not be moving so fast if it didn't have to constantly outrun is own collapse.
