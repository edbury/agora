# Nightmare on Cerberus Station

- Elevator is stuck at Control after a critical failure
- Pi's voicebox has been fixed and he has a Monarch logo on his neck
- Kruger has used the wormhole, but his coordinates are downstairs
- The Dead Planet coords are also downstairs
- The Gaunt is aware of their presence and has sent Husks to Docking to disable the ship
- Cerberus believes that Doctor X is Dr. Emil (for now)
- Gravity will turn off every 47 minutes, in sync with the wormhole fluctuations

## TFG Connections

The wormhole is an opening to the Dead Dimension a la Dead Planet.

Husk events occur on the same timeline as on The Alexis. 

Unlike the Alexis: 
- Computer/Android effects only occur within the Project CHARON room.
- The dead completely reanimate into Husks

Unlike Cerberus:
- Use Gaunt Walker anywhere the Flesh Heap is
- Use 1d10 Gaunt Crawlers anywhere the Nervous System is
- Use more lowkey stats for Husks
  - C:35 I:30 2(-), 3dmg

## NPCs

### Unit 31415. 

Nickname: Pi.

An android, extremely unsettling. Is willing to help the players if they ask, and knows the full backstory of the events here.

## The Station

The station is abandoned, and all power is off. Lights, oxygen, and elevators are offline. Security doors and airlocks are sealed shut, but can be supplied with an external power source or forced open. Power can be reactivated from Cerberus’ control centre [see: Control].

The station is eerie. The walls creak and noises can be heard above and below. There are no bodies, but blood stains in every room. The second the players step foot on the station, they are hunted. [see: Monsters]

To escape, the players need to find a Fuel Cell [see: Engineering] and return safely to their ship. There are no other ships on the station.

Each area beyond Docking contains an encounter. Some are included in the area description, but for others, see the Building Encounters table.

### Elevators

The elevators are offline, but can be reactivated with emergency power in Control. They can be used to quickly reach any location as marked on the map.  

The elevators will not transport to any location with abnormal gravity. At the start of the adventure this includes Observation and Engineering. Reactivating gravity from Engineering will fix this.

### Escape

The terrors that haunt Cerberus are controlled by some great intelligence. If they players to try to leave, the intelligence will do everything it can to stop them. Escape will be a mad scramble from the deadliest monsters on the station.

Project CHARON has become self-sustaining. If the players wish to destroy it, the only way is to create a large explosion and de-orbit to station, crashing it into the planet. [See: Control]

### Rooms

#### Docking

>From your cabins, you look out the viewports to see Cerberus Station floating in the distance. The station is dark and silent. Suddenly, the captain's voice crackles over the intercom. "Alright crew, we've arrived at Cerberus Station. But something doesn't look right. The lights are off and the mechanical arm for docking is damaged. We'll need to fix it or use the cables from the docking tube to tether the ship in place."

>As you look out the viewports, you can see the station orbiting the large planet below. The planet is a deep shade of blue with swirling white clouds. The silence of the station is broken by the sound of the ship's engines as the captain maneuvers the ship towards the docking tube. You can see the damaged mechanical arm, and you can also see the cables hanging from the docking tube. The captain asks you what you want to do, fix the arm or use the cables?

>As you are discussing the options, the communications officer interjects, "Captain, I'm picking up a distress signal from Cerberus Station. It says 'Catastrophic Emergency. Do not dock under any circumstances'." They are silent for a moment before the captain's voice sounds over comms again, "Y'all should come up to the bridge."

##### Beyond the Tube

There are no Fuel Cells here, only the exploded remains of one (likely the cause of the damaged mechanical arm). A security terminal (battery powered, still operational) lies just inside. Once the terminal is accessed, give the players the ‘Security Terminal’ handout.

#### Cargo

A maze of shelves, containers, and industrial storage equipment. Spread around are 1d5 empty vaccsuits, and 1d5 Husks wearing vaccsuits [see: Monsters]. In the darkness, they are indistinguishable from each other without close inspection.

#### Security

Locked with a security door, requiring power and a valid keycard. Contains shelves of various weapons: SMGs, Revolvers, Stun Batons. 1 Grenade in a locked case. The ‘Project Notes’ handout is on the floor.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 6 - Rescue a survivor
d10 -> 3 - A flooded room; Radioactivity
d10 -> 1 - 1 Husk
d10 -> 2 - 2 Environmental Hazards

#### Observation

A large room, with a massive floor-to-ceiling viewing window. Artificial gravity in this room is broken, flipping the room sideways. The observation window is now a glass floor - it will break if players try to cross without caution. The door to continue is at the far end of the room. Various items are at risk of falling and breaking the glass. The Nervous System will stalk the players and attack if they take too long to cross the glass.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 1 - Survive an attack
d10 -> 2 - Cracking glass (into space)
d10 -> 8 - Gaunt Crawler; 1d5 husks
d10 -> 3 - 2 Deadly Threats

#### Control

The main control room for Cerberus Station. Emergency power can be activated from here, reactivating the lights, oxygen, security doors, and elevators.

Unit 31415 [see: NPC] is hiding here. Once power has returned, station telemetry hints that the Cerberus’ orbit has become unstable, and a large explosion could cause the station to crash land into the planet below.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 9 - Disarm an explosive
d10 -> 6 - Fluctuating gravity
d10 -> 5 - Gaunt Walker
d10 -> 4 - The Objective is high up

#### Living Quarters

Bunks, rooms, common areas, and bathrooms for the whole crew. One room is overflowing with human bones.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 8 - Find a hidden item
d10 -> 2 - Cracking glass (into Space)
d10 -> 7 - Auto-Turret (Pulse Rifle)
d10 -> 10 - Two complications: The Hazard gets worse; Flailing cables

#### Labs

Labs of every kind imaginable. Anything players want to improvise weapons, tools, or explosives can be found here.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 2 - Reach the exit
d10 -> 9 - toxic waste
d10 -> 5 - Gaunt Walker
d10 -> 4 - the objective is high up

#### Project CHARON

A computer terminal near this area includes the ‘Distress Log’ audio file. An enormous test chamber, with walls coated in human skin. A miniature worm hole pulsates at its centre. Looking directly at the worm hole results in an immediate roll on the Panic Table.

The players enter the room via a rickety gantry, high above the portal. Entry to Engineering is at the far end of the gantry. The Nervous System (if alive), will try to collapse the gantry and drop the players into the room. 1d5 Husks attack.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 7 - recover an important datapad
d10 -> 7 - zero gravity
d10 -> 10 - the station ai
d10 -> 7 - falling debris

#### Engineering

A large warehouse-sized room. Gravity has failed completely, the whole room is Zero-G. Emergency gravitational controls can be found in this room to return gravity to normal. The Flesh Heap [see: Monsters] lives here, dormant. It will wake and attack if disturbed.

There is a large supply of Fuel Cells.

##### Encounter

d10 -> 9 - disarm an explosive
d10 -> 3 - a flooded room
d10 -> 10 -  the station ai
d10 -> 1 - the hazard gets worse
