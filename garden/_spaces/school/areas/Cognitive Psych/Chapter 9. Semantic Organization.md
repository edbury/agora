# Semantic Organization

>A scientist must organize. One makes a science with facts in the same way that one makes a house with stones; but an accumulation of facts is no more a science than a pile of stones is a house. —Henri Poincare

semantic network 
: A theory proposing that semantic information is organized in long-term memory by linking concepts to related concepts

spreading activation 
: A theoretical construct proposing that activation spreads from a concept in a semantic network to activate related concepts
: Spreading activation means that the activation of a concept can lead to the activation of related concepts as the activation spreads along the paths of the network.

## Organization and recall

### Recall of hierarchical information

Semantic organization of the material improved recall, even though the organization did not consist of a hierarchy. The difference between the organized and random conditions was more striking for hierarchical organization, however, suggesting that hierarchical organization is particularly effective.

### Building semantic networks

One way to organize information is to construct a semantic network. Semantic networks show how concepts are related to each other. Networks are typically represented by diagrams in which the concepts are called nodes and the lines showing the relationship between two concepts are called links.

: The format for representing concepts in a semantic network

links 
: The format for representing relations in a semantic network

## Verification of semantic statements

The first part of this chapter emphasized how effective organization, particularly hierarchical organization, increased the amount of information that we can retrieve from LTM.
  - Hierarchical organization also influences the time required to retrieve information.
  - The time it takes to respond to different kinds of statements provides some clues about the organization of semantic memory.

feature comparison model 
: A model proposing that items are categorized by matching the item’s features to category features
: The feature comparison model assumes that instances are classified by comparing the features, or attributes, of the two nouns representing the member and the cate- gory.
- To verify that a robin is a bird, a person would compare the features of *robin* with the features of *bird*.

hierarchical network model 
: A model proposing that items are categorized by using the hierarchical relations specified in a semantic network
: In contrast, the hierarchical network model assumes that category information is stored directly in memory by means of associations.
- The right half of Figure 9.4 shows that robin is associated with *bird* and *bird* is associated with *animal*.

### The hierarchical network model

Each word in the network is stored with pointers (arrows) showing how it is related to other words in the network.

The pointers also show how features are stored at different levels in the hierarchy.
- Features true of all animals—such as eating and breathing—are stored at the highest level. Features that apply to basic-level categories—such as that birds have wings, can fly, and have feathers—are stored at an intermediate level. Properties stored at the lowest level are true for that particular member but not for all members of the category. It is at this level that we know a canary is yellow and can sing.

One advantage of this kind of network is that it provides an economical way to store information because the information does not have to be repeated at each of the three levels.
- It isn’t necessary to specify that eating and breathing are features of birds, fish, canaries, ostriches, sharks, and salmon, because the network tells us that all are examples of animals, which eat and breathe.

This economy of storage comes at a cost, however:
- Retrieval of the fact that a canary eats requires two inferences—first, that a canary is a bird and, second, that a bird is an animal
- In other words, it is necessary to go to the appropriate level in the hierarchy before retrieving the features stored at that level.

Collins and Quillian (1969) used the model for that purpose by making two primary assumptions:
- that it takes time to move from one level in the hierarchy to another
- that additional time is required if it is necessary to retrieve the features stored at one of the levels

Facilitation occurs when the retrieval of information is made easier because the previous question required retrieval of similar information.
- For example, it should be easier to verify a property of a canary if the previous question was also about a canary.

This concept can be illustrated by considering whether it would be easier to verify that “A canary is a bird.” after “A canary can fly.” or after “A canary can sing.” The answer isn’t intuitively obvious, but the network model predicts that “A canary can fly.” should cause greater facilitation because the property fly is stored at the bird level, and sing is stored at the canary level.
  - The data were quite supportive of the prediction that the extent of semantic facilitation depends on using the same path as the previous question

There are two findings, however, that the model does not account for without additional assumptions.
- The first is that it is possible to find instances in which verification time is not a function of levels in the hierarchy.
  - For example, it takes longer to verify that a chimpanzee is a primate than that a chimpanzee is an animal. The network model should predict the opposite because primate, like bird and fish, is at a lower level in the hierarchy than animal.
- The second finding is that the network model does not account for the typicality effect
  - It is easier to verify that a canary is a bird than that an ostrich is a bird. However, because both are one level from bird, as is illustrated in Figure 9.5, the model does not predict the differences in response time.

typicality effect 
: The finding that the more typical members of a category are classified more quickly than the less typical category members
: the fact that more typical members of categories are easier to classify than less typical ones

### The feature comparison model

This model assumes that the meaning of words can be represented in memory by a list of features and that classifications are made by comparing features rather than by examining links in a network

defining feature 
: A feature that is necessary to be a member of that category
: Defining features are features that an entity must have to be a member of a category

characteristic feature 
: A feature that is usually present in members of that category, but is not necessary
: characteristic features are usually possessed by category members but are not necessary

The defining features for birds might include being alive and having feathers and wings; the characteristic features might include being able to fly and being within a certain size range

The feature comparison model has two stages. 
- The first stage compares all the features of two concepts to determine how similar one concept is to the other.
  - For example, to determine whether a robin is a bird, we would compare the features of robin with the features of bird. If the comparison reveals that the two concepts are either very similar or very dissimilar, we can respond true or false immediately.
- The second stage is necessary when the degree of similarity is between the two extremes. The answer isn’t obvious in this case, so the model proposes that we examine only the defining features to determine whether the example has the necessary features of the category

The probability that the second stage is necessary increases as the similarity between the category concept and the example decreases. The model therefore predicts that the more typical members of a category (such as robin, sparrow, blue jay) should be classified more rapidly than the less typical members (chicken, goose, duck) because evaluating the defining features during the second stage slows the classification.

The reverse argument applies to false statements such as “A bat is a bird.” High similarity between a negative example and a category concept makes it more difficult to reject the example.

In contrast, two dissimilar noun pairs (“A pencil is a bird.”) share so few features that an immediate decision can be made during the first stage.

The feature comparison model, unlike the hierarchical network model, provides an explanation of why some false statements are evaluated more quickly than others.

Another advantage of the feature comparison model is that, unlike the network model, it can account for the reversal of the category-size effect.

category-size effect 
: The finding that members of smaller categories are classified more quickly than members of larger categories
: The category-size effect refers to the fact that people are usually able to classify a member into a smaller category faster than into a larger category
- for example, verifying that a collie is a dog more quickly than that a collie is an animal.

Some cases, however, violate the category-size effect because the classification times are faster for the larger category.
- For example, people were able to verify more quickly that Scotch is a drink than that Scotch is a liquor, even though drink is a larger category than liquor.

The feature comparison model can account for violations of the category-size effect because its predictions are based on similarity rather than category size.

#### Limitations of the feature comparison model

it relies on similarity ratings to make most of its predictions. It’s not very surprising that, if people rate an example as highly similar to their concept of a category, they will be fast to verify that it belongs to that category.

A second criticism of the feature comparison model is its proposal that all classifications require computations—that we use the features of concepts to compute their degree of similarity.
- If we have learned that a robin is a bird, it would seem easier to use this information directly rather than computing the similarity between robin and bird.

A third criticism of the feature comparison model is the argument against necessary, or defining, features

In conclusion, the feature comparison model has some advantages over the hierarchical network model, but it also has some limitations. It is more promising for those concepts that we believe have defining features (Malt, 1990) and for those situations in which we use features to make a decision (Keil & Batterman, 1984; McNamara & Miller, 1989). A compromise is that at different times we use either direct associations—links in a semantic network—or features to evaluate a concept.

### The spreading activation model

spreading activation model 
: A model that accounts for response times by formulating assumptions about how activation spreads in a semantic network
: representative of semantic network models in its emphasis on concepts joined together by links that show relationships between concepts

A change from the hierarchical network model is that the length of each link represents the degree of semantic relatedness between two concepts.

Notice that the model can now account for the typicality effect because the links represent different degrees of semantic relatedness.
- The shorter links reveal that the more typical examples car and bus are more closely related to vehicle than are ambulance and fire engine.

The spreading activation model assumes that, when a concept is processed, activation spreads out along the paths of a network, but its effectiveness is decreased as it travels outward.
- For example, presentation of the word red should strongly activate closely related concepts such as orange and fire and should cause less activation of concepts such as sunsets and roses.

The model therefore predicts the typicality effect because more typical members will activate the superordinate category sooner than less typical members

The model also assumes that activation decreases over time or intervening activity. This assumption places a constraint on the amount of activation that can occur because the activation of a second concept will decrease the activation of the first concept.

One controversy regarding the spreading activation model (Ratcliff & McKoon, 1988) is whether activation spreads beyond a single node as predicted by the model.
- According to the model, activation should spread from BREAD to BUTTER to POPCORN, but POPCORN should be less activated than BUTTER because activation decreases in strength as it spreads outward.
- Research supports the assumption that spreading activation facilitates identification of words that are two links away from the activated word, but the facilitation is weaker than for words directly linked to the activated word

#### Limitations of the spreading activation model

the spreading activation model also allows for the use of feature matching (as in the feature comparison model) to verify semantic relations. The price of this advantage, however, is that it is very hard to test the model. If a model becomes so flexible that it is consistent with almost any experimental finding, it loses its predictive power.

They find the model’s main weaknesses to be both the number of assumptions made and the failure to make many clearcut predictions based on it. In fact, the model was developed primarily to show how its assumptions are consistent with existing data rather than to make interesting new predictions.

## Schema theory

schema 
: A general knowledge structure that provides a framework for organizing clusters of knowledge
: A schema is a cluster of knowledge that represents a general procedure, object, percept, event, sequence of events, or social situation

Schema theory refers to a collection of models presuming that we encode such knowledge clusters into memory and use them to comprehend and store our experiences.

### Bartlett's schema theory

He defined a schema as an active organization of past experiences in which the mind abstracts a general cognitive structure to represent many particular instances of those experiences. 

A fundamental assumption of Bartlett’s schema theory is that all new information interacts with old information represented in the schema.

Brewer and Nakamura (1984) point out that a number of fundamental differences exist between schema theory and the S-R approach to psychology. These include:
1. Atomistic versus molar. An S-R theory is atomistic and is based on small units of knowledge (a single stimulus). A schema is a much larger unit, showing how knowledge is combined into clusters.
2. Associationistic versus nonassociationistic. An S-R theory requires learn- ing an association between a stimulus and a response. A schema provides a knowledge structure for interpreting and encoding aspects of a particu- lar experience.
3. Particularistic versus generic. An S-R theory shows the association between a particular stimulus and a particular response. A schema is more general and represents a variety of particular instances, much as a prototype represents the particular instances of a category.
4. Passive versus active. The association between a stimulus and a response can be learned in a passive manner. Invoking a schema is a more active process in which a particular experience is matched to the schema that best fits that experience.

### Modern schema theory

According to Rumelhart, a schema theory is basically a theory about how knowledge is represented and about how that representation facilitates the use of knowledge in various ways. Schemas are used to interpret sensory data, retrieve information from memory, organize action, and solve problems.

An advantage of having schematic knowledge is that we can sometimes rely on default knowledge—that is, likely values that enable us to make intelligent guesses in the absence of specific knowledge.
- For example, most lecture courses offer the same number of credits, so you could probably guess how many credits you would receive for a cognitive psychology course before looking it up.

default knowledge
: Knowledge about the most likely values for the attributes of a schema

### Scripts: representing sequences of events

Part of our schematic knowledge is organized around routine activities
- for example, going to a restaurant, visiting a dentist, changing a flat tire, or rid- ing a bus.

script 
: Knowledge about what occurs during routine activities
: Schank and Abelson (1977) used the term script to refer to what we know about the sequence of events that make up such routine activities.

Because the sequence of events is quite standard, a natural way of organizing scripts is according to the temporal order in which the events occur.

One interpretation of these conflicting findings is that both the centrality and the temporal order of events influence how we use our memory. The more central events provide the quickest access to a script, but the temporal order of events is useful for retrieving all the events that are in the script.

## The perceptual symbols model

amodal 
: Knowledge that is abstracted from sensory experiences
: All theories described thus far in this chapter are amodal because they do not directly represent the perceptual experiences encountered in learning about concepts.

modal 
: Knowledge is represented as sensory experiences
: A perceptual symbols system is a modal approach because it stores sensory experiences such as audition, vision, taste, smell, and touch.

Amodal systems represent perceptual information indirectly as a list of features or as a list of associations in a semantic network. In contrast, perceptual symbol systems retrieve information from LTM by reenacting or simulating perceptual experiences.

The strong neural basis of perceptual symbols reflects the important role that research by cognitive neuroscientists has played in shaping the model, including the reactivation hypothesis that encoding areas of the brain are reactivated during later retrieval

### Semantic verification

Zwaan and Yaxley (2003) proposed that if people use images to help them make the decision, the position of the words should influence response times.
- When the vertical alignment of the words matched the alignment in our images (ATTIC above BASEMENT), students were significantly faster in verifying semantic relatedness than when the alignments mismatched (BASEMENT above ATTIC).

Another advantage of a modal theory is that it can account for slower response times when there is a shift from one modality to another.

if people simulate information, they should be slower when they have to shift modalities when verifying properties in a conceptual task

The results confirmed the prediction that people would be slower in verifying properties when there was a shift in modality.
- People were slower, for example, in verifying that a “BLENDER can be loud” when it was preceded by “CRANBERRIES can be tart” then when it was preceded by “LEAVES can be rustling.”

The perceptual symbols model suggests that it should take less time to verify a conceptual property when the statement was preceded by a perceptual judgment from the same modality.
- People were faster in verifying auditory (a bee buzzes), tactual (a coin is hard), and visual (an inner tube is black) statements after judging the location of a perceptual signal that was in the same modality as the conceptual statement.

### Autobiographical memory

A major assumption of the perceptual symbols model is that we reenact or simulate our experiences.

autobiographical memory 
: Memory about our personal experiences

Because, there are many memory systems that need to interact, memory becomes highly constructive, with the constructions guided by specific schemas associated with the different systems.

Rubin proposes that there are also differences between the episodic tasks studied in the laboratory and the events that occur in our lives:
- Items in episodic memory usually do not tell a story. Our lives do. The retention interval for items in episodic memory is typically less than one hour.
- Autobiographical memories may last an entire lifetime. Autobiographical memories consist of many modalities. 
- Laboratory tasks typically focus on a single modality.
- Episodic retrieval has minimal emotional involvement. Autobiographical retrieval may be emotional.

### Resolution?

This research on autobiographical memory is consistent with the perceptual symbols view that our memories allow us to relive our experiences through simulations that have emotional and perceptual content.

A reasonable answer at this point in our understanding of memory is that some knowledge is stored in an amodal form and other knowledge is stored in a modal form that supports simulations

The complementary roles of centrality and temporal order in verifying the content of scripts (Figure 9.9) is consistent with the claim that both modal and amodal codes are important in memory.

it is not clear how perceptual simulations can be used to represent integrated knowledge that requires organizing hundreds of concepts

The strength of the perceptual symbols theory for simulating particular cases and of semantic networks for organizing hundreds of cases can be combined in a hybrid system in which perceptual information is linked to concepts organized in a semantic network.

## Summary

The hierarchical organization of categories influences the amount of time it takes to verify sentences about the members of categories. It usually takes less time to verify category membership at the basic level than at the superordinate level.
- For example, it is easier to verify that a canary is a bird than that a canary is an animal.

The model also predicts that the time it takes to verify a property of an object will depend on the level in the hierarchy where the property is stored
- This assumption implies that it should take longer to verify that a canary eats than that a canary can fly, because eating is stored at the animal level and flying is stored at the bird level.

In contrast, the feature comparison model assumes that statements are verified by using features to compute the similarity of two concepts. When there is an intermediate amount of similarity, people must evaluate only the most necessary, or defining, features of the category.

The spreading activation model was proposed to correct some limitations of the hierarchical network model. Its main assumption is that activation of a concept results in activation of related concepts spreading along the paths of the network.

The integration of knowledge into larger clusters is the primary assumption of schema theory.

In contrast to stimulus-response associations, schematic structures are molar, nonassociationistic, generic, and active. They provide a skeleton structure that can be filled out with the detailed properties of a particular instance, using default knowledge when information is missing. 

In contrast to the previous models, the perceptual symbols model assumes that verification of semantic statements occurs through mental simulations.
