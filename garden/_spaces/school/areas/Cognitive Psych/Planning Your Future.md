# Planning Your Future

## Decision Making Without Options

- first lecture covers how decisions could be made when given the choice between options
  - are we always given a set of solutions?
  - are all decision making solutions similar to those that we see in the lab (time, clearly defined outcomes, etc)?

## Defining this Topic

- decision event - making a single decision rather than a sequence of decisions in a changing situation
  - finals week and allocating your time example
  - walking on the street when a fight breaks out right in front of you example

## What Makes These Unique

- unstructured problems
- uncertain environment that is changing
- unclear and shifting goals and options
- time pressure
- high stakes
- larger scale goals (organizational and individual)

## Who Makes the "Best" Response

- Recognition-primed decisions (RPD) - an informed decision that is quickly made following recognition of a situation (Klein, 1993)
  - importance of experience
  - need for practice in these decision making activities
  - superior benefits of experience and practice

## So How Do You Apply This?

- know your experience when faced with a decision event
  - with decision events
  - with the topic at hand
- consider the known and unknown factors
  - time constraints
    - should versus must issue
  - costs and benefits
  - timeline of events
  - optimal outcomes

## For this Class: Planning Your Final

- what is your experience level with finals and decision making that is being used?
- what factors do i need to consider?
  - when do i need to take it?
  - what else is pending outside of the class?
  - what is the best grade i can earn based on what i've done?
  - what are the costs and benefits out of slow versus brief studying?

## Your Turn

- Think of a few other situations I'll be running into where these decision events will come into play
- Hopefully the information from this class will help me approach them in a more aware manner
