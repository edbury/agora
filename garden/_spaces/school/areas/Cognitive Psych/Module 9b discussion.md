>Do you think communication confusion occurs more frequently during written language (think text messages, emails, etc.) or spoken language communication? Explain why you think this is the case - and try to use terminology in your response that relate to this moduleâ€™s information.

In my personal experience, I feel that communication confusion occurs more frequently during written communication than spoken communication, especially face-to-face spoken communication. However, this it's possible that this is context-, content-, and person-dependent.

Speech errors may be less likely in written speech because written communication is not necessarily immediate. That is, a text message *may* be sent with the immediacy of spoken language, but the medium itself allows for review and editing. This two-step process allows for the removal of the types of exchange errors mentioned in the module. However, several features of spoken communication are entirely absent from written communication (at least in English).

First, normal written language does not convey phonemic information directly. In one case, this allows homonyms and homographs to introduce ambiguity. Context ideally allows the reader to hone in on the correct meaning, and written speech benefits from a lack of immediacy here. That is, if the contextual information is present, it may be less likely to be missed because it's statically available in writing. Another case, however, is harder to account for: tone. In spoken communication, we are able to indicate sarcasm, sincerity, inquisitiveness, earnestness, and more with the tone of our voice. In my experience, *many* written communications suffer from confusion when that tone is not being communicated by additional written context. For example, someone may mistake a joke for serious intent. (Key and Peele have a wonderful sketch about this.)

Second, written communication omits the possibility of gesturing. While gestures may be mentally simulated while reading written communication, the speech-producer is unable to utilize them for direct effect. This includes tonal context (e.g., large, aggressive gestures) as well as supplementary content ("It was about this big."). In order to account for this information, written speech is required to be longer and more descriptive.

Before closing, I'll note that emoji do fill some of the gaps mentioned here. Though the selection of emojis is finite, tone can be indicated via different expressive emoji and gestures can be symbolically inserted in the same way. I don't think emoji are a complete stand-in for tonality or dynamic gestures, but they represent a change in the limits of written speech.
