## Intro

> It took six hours for Foundation field agents to secure the Carpathia; two of those were spent breaching the sealed flight deck to recover D-636. The last thing you remember is being cleared of contaminants by field technician Rutova. You were then escorted onto the Foundation ship Barishal and placed in stasis -- for your own protection, of course. Based on the Jacobson unit's terminal display, that was six weeks ago.

## The Barishal

> The doors to your Jacobson units hang open, slick gel spilling onto the floor. In the distance, you hear the repeating tone of an incoming message.

The Barishal is completely empty of personnel. A walkabout of the ship reveals the following facilities:

- Command deck
- Recreation room
- Med bay
- Living quarters
- Washrooms
- Galley
- Cargo bay
- Jacobson module
- Engine
- Oxygen and water processing
- Cryochambers

The repeating tone is coming from the command deck, where a transmission from Site 17 Director Aosta is waiting.

- The Carpathia has been towed to Site 24, you should be able to see it floating outside the window.
- In exchange for jurisdiction over the Carpathia, Site 17 agents were to assist in resolving a containment breach at the facility. That was eight days ago.
- No communications from Site 24 or the Barishal have been received since then.
- If a full-site containment breach is confirmed, the O5 council has authorized transfer of control to Director Aosta. However, this will require two things.
  - 1. A contained, unmodified sample of whatever caused the breach.
  - 2. A full download of Site 24's server backups.
- If both of these can be recovered, Aosta is prepared to offer the volunteers immediate satisfactory completion of service hours, a Hazard 5 stipend for this job, and command codes for the Barishal.
- Failure likely means the destruction of the facility from orbit.

## Bloom Modifications

### Communications

12 days ago - Communication with Choi Labs about Artifact 21 going missing. "It's just a fucking screwdriver."

### Closed Environ Testing 

Stasis chambers, most of them shattered by the force of the flooding. Floating in one chamber is D-113, his skin and hair completely devoid of any hue.
