# Something New: Rules vs Exemplars

## How do we categorize?

- Concept identification through rules - a task that requires deciding whether an item is an example of a concept
  - Logical rule - creating categories based on logical relations
  - Attribute rule - creating categories based on attributes of the objects
    - Disjunctive rule - categorization requiring just one of several components
    - Conjunctive rule - categorization requiring all of the required components

## But are groups always about rules?

- Typicality - an estimate of how well an item represents the category that it belongs to
  - Example: write down 10 furniture items then rank them on their "furniture-like" qualities
- How do we determine typicality?
  - Family resemblance - a measure of how frequently the attributes of a category member are shared by other members of that category

### Is this always how we judge typicality?

- Goal-derived categorization - category whose members are selected to satisfy a specific goal
  - Example: looking for the right clothes to wear to a party
- Note: goal-derived categories don't seem to place a higher value on typicality; in fact, it might actually lower the value of that item
- Ideal - an attribute value that relates to the goal of a goal-derived category

## What about new items?

- Prototype rule - a classification strategy that selects the category whose prototype is the most similar to the classified item
  - Effort and calculation requirements
  - Used most often in continuous classifications
- Feature-frequency rule - a classification strategy that selects the category having the most feature matches with the classified item
  - Effort and calculation requirements
  - Used most often in distinct classifications

## Is there anything else we can use?

- Exemplars - items that are considered a "best" representation of a category
- Nearest-neighbor rule - a strategy that selects the category containing an item most similar to the classified item
  - Problems when new items are similar to outliers of a group
- Average distance rule - a strategy that selects the category containing items having the greatest average similarity to the classified item
  - Time cost concerns with this technique

## So what _do_ we use?

- Both
- Despite evidence that we do usually classify new information based on prototypes and rules, we do use exemplars on occasion
- Exemplars have been proven to be used in situations where there is focus on the features of an item
- Exemplars also seem to be used more often by "experts" on a category
