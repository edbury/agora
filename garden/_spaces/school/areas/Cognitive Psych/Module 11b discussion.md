Describe a decision event where you made a bad decision - then a decision event where you made a good decision. After this, see if you can figure out a reason for why you made a poor decision in one event, while you made a good one in the other.

# Bad Decision

This week I made a bad decision that is all too familiar. After enjoying a lean post-workout lunch, the server asked if they could get me anything else. I hadn't planned on eating anything else--in fact, I was quite full. However, in the heat of the moment I asked for a milkshake to go. The milkshake did not disappoint, but every sip came with a slight tinge of guilt.

I think a major component of this was how I had resolved earlier, related want-should dilemmas that day. I remember thinking to myself, "Well... I *did* work out earlier, and that lunch was so healthy!" I definitely felt entitled to selecting a *want* after those earlier *shoulds*.

# Good Decision

Earlier today, I was asked if I could train a coworker I have a frictive relationship with. Honestly, I find them so aversive that the idea immediately turned my mood sour. My immediate instincts were to find a cordial excuse or simply say no based on my aversion. Instead, I agreed, and the training went very well.

I think part of my success here was being able to identify how my mood was affecting my availability heuristic. Not only was I basing the likelihood of a poor experience on my past experiences, my sour mood was amplifying that by selecting poor experiences (where I was also feeling sour) more often. Knowing that, taking a moment to reset my nervous system a little, and start again earnestly opened me up to more optimistic probabilities.
