# The Spreading Activation Theory

## How do we access semantic categories?

- We know that semantic organization appears to help us better recall and make sense of information, but how do we access it (i.e., "a cat has four legs")?
  - Feature comparison model - a model of accessing information by comparing the features of the items
  - Hierarchical network model - a model of accessing information by the hierarchical relations specified in a semantic network

## A third option: the spreading activation model

  - Spreading activation model - responses to questions are a result of connections made within semantic networks
    - Strong relationship (greater accessibility) = closer proximity in the model = quicker access
    - More connections = slower access

### Strengths and weakness of the spreading activation model

- +'s
  - great ability to predict reaction time to questions
  - accounts for the typicality effect, the category size effect, and the criteria for "important" features
- -'s
  - inability to explain why the connections were made
  - a theory that results from the data, not a theory supported by the data

### Can anything help support this?

- brain imaging seems to replicate the spreading activation effect, even if the explanations aren't perfect
- this model also seems to account for false memories, which look almost identical to real memories when examining brain activity
  - note on the sensory area activation differences
