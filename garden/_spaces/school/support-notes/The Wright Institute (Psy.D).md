    There are many characteristics that lend themselves to becoming a great psychologist.  Some of the strengths you may already possess would be, for example, good listening skills, being able to convey a sense of hope, having compassion, possessing cultural humility and being multiculturally aware and sensitive, helping to normalize reactions to abnormal circumstances, openness to feedback, and willingness to look at oneself - self-awareness.  I also value students who demonstrate psychological mindedness.  Surely, a characteristic that is necessary is maturity and professionalism.  Thereâ€™s more we can address in live responses.
