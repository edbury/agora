## Modules
### Module 5 - Memory Codes

>This module will attempt to explore the topic of memory as an overarching whole concept. Instead of breaking up memory into different components like in previous modules, we will examine the general findings about memory strengths, weaknesses, and processes. This module will focus primarily on how memory research can be used to better enhance memory capabilities.

### Module 6 - Visual Memory and Manipulation

>This module will cover the last memory topic explored in this class. In this module, we will examine the concept of visual memory. In particular, we will look at how our minds address and store visual images that we encounter in our environment. We will additionally examine how we can manipulate and interact with visual information within our minds at the end of this module.

### Module 7 - Categorization

>This topic will discuss several concepts addressing how our minds could potentially organize and sort out the information present in the world. It will also examine research that has looked at exactly how this process does seem to work. In the closing of the module, we'll explore how expertise in specific topics might alter the mental framework used to categorize information in our minds.

### Module 8 - Semantic Organization

> This new module continues the discussion of organization of information in the brain. However, unlike the last module that examines how information could be separated into different categories in our minds, this module would focus on how we incorporate several concepts related to a topic in our mind. We'll primarily focus on models like the spreading activation theory and all of the implications that come from these theories.

#### Lectures

### Module 9 - Language

>This module will focus on the topic of language. Specifically, we'll examine the rules of language explored by cognitive psychologists, the way that we apply these rules, and the cognitive/biological mechanisms involved in applying these rules. We'll also examine the implications obtained when examining how multiple languages impact the rules and processes learned when mastering language.

### Module 10 - Problem Solving

>This module will focus on how the mind handles mental challenges. It will explore how we address new and familiar issues in our world. We will also be spending time comparing the different techniques that can be used when attempting to solve problems -- in particular, we'll spend considerable time examining the topics of heuristics and algorithms.

### Module 11 - Decision Making

> This last module will focus on how we make a choice when multiple options are present. To begin our discussion, we'll first explore the variety of types of decisions that we must make. To better understand this topic, we'll also explore how framing, context, and other components impact the decision making process.
