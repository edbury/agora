# The Challenge of Visual Memory

## The Frustration with Visual Memory

- For decades, we've known that applying visual images to items that we'd like to recall increased our changes of retaining those items
  - Method of Loci
  - Paivio, Smythe, & Yuille's 1986 study
    - High and low imagery word pairs
    - HH 11/12, HL 9.5/12, LH 7/12, LL 6/12
- But when we use visual images to retain things, is our mind actually doing something special. In other words, are we actually storing visual information in our mind?

## Let's Explore the Challenge

- Close your eyes and imagine the face of someone that you haven't seen in some time but you would still be able to recognize immediately
  - Can you clearly see every detail of that person's face?
  - Even if you can, how could a researcher verify this?
- Penny experiment example
  - Nickerson & Adams, 1979

## Another Issue

- If our memory of visual information is so flawless, why can't we manipulate memories of it in our mind like verbal information?
  - Chambers & Resiberg, 1992 (Bunny/Duck)
    - Most people struggle to identify the _other_ animal in the picture after the fact (unless they have ready about the experiment or identified the animal previously)

## So What is Visual Memory?

- Most theorists propose that visual memory is a very detailed semantic summary of critical pieces of information that we can combine in a somewhat blurry image in our mind
- It does, however, seem to be something that we can interact with in a visual manner
  - Fictional map study by Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser (1978)
  - Farah's 1988 research on brain activity in the visual cortex
  - Levine, Warach, & Farah's 1985 research on visual memory location skills for those with occipital lobe damage

## What Does this Mean for You?

- Visual memory is a very powerful form of memory
- It also seems to be a distinct form of memory in comparison to the other memory items we've discussed
- However, it is not a perfect entity, and there are many unanswered questions about how it works
- So, take advantage of the information that we've acquired, but know that there's probably more for psychologists to learn about the topic
