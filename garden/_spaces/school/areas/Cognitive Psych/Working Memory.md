# Working Memory

## What is Working Memory?
Working memory is a combination of:
- Short-term memory of information we're processing
- Information that we're recalling from our memory to apply to a new situation
- Strategies we're using to integrate that information

## How is it Different from STM?
- STM focuses on the information that you have just recently been presented
- Researchers examining memory often focus on STM when studying topics like capacity, encoding, and retention
- However, we quickly realized that our ability to attend to and store information in the real world becomes difficult because we're attending to more than just new information at any given moment

## Baddeley's Theory of Working Memory
- Original theory had three components
  - The phonological loop
  - The visuospatial sketchpad
  - The central executive
- Later added:
  - The episodic buffer

- Baddeley argued that things like retention, capacity, and encoding must consider these components if we are truly going to study memory in the real world

- Capacity research shows that all components can disrupt capacity of others (using up some of available 7 +/- 2 items)
- Distraction research shows that you can lower memory of each component separately
  - Phrase activity
  - Key stroke activity
  - Random number activity
