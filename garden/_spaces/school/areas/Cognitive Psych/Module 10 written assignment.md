# Difficult Problems
## 8 Coin Problem

This problem requires the solver to organize eight identical coins such that each coin touches exactly three other coins. In the starting state, the coins are arranged in two offset rows of four, so the top row rests in the divots created by the offset. The solver is allowed to arrange the coins however they see fit. No other constraints are mentioned.

I would classify this as an arrangement problem because it requires arranging the constituent parts (the coins) to satisfy the solution criterion (each coin must touch three others).

While solving this problem, I noticed that three facets of my experience were startlingly close to those mentioned in the chapter. First, when I did arrive at the solution, it felt like a flash of insight. I had been mentally moving coins and drawing their arrangements, waiting for something to "click" before suddenly realizing the path forward. Second, the primary hinge in arriving at that moment of insight was removing an unnecessary constraint: the coins did not need to be arranged in 3D space. Finally, I only realized that I had been working under an unnecessary constraint when I considered changing my representation. 

The problem was presented in two dimensions, so that is how I began working. However, once I considered grabbing a handful of quarters to toy with, I immediately realized that I could arrange the coins in three dimensions. Retrieving the actual coins was unnecessary because the solution came to mind immediately after the dimensional constraint was lifted!

## Five-Handed-Monster Problem

This problem involves a scenario where three five-handed monsters of different sizes (small, medium, and large) each hold a differently-sized globe (small, medium, and large). In the starting state, the small monster is holding the large globe, the medium monster is holding the small globe, and the large monster is holding the medium globe. The goal is to reach an end state where each monster is holding a globe of symmetrical size (i.e., the medium monster with the medium globe). The possible moves have additional constraints relating to when and how globes can be transferred between monsters. For example, only one globe may be transferred at a time.

I would classify this as a transformation problem because it consists of a starting state, a goal state, and an unspecified series of operations to change from one to the other. The task here is not to recognize a pattern or arrange parts (despite "moving" the globes around) but to discover the sequence of moves required to transform the initial state into the desired end state.

Again, I noticed three aspects of the reading come into play while solving this problem. First, I recognized this problem as an isomorph of the Tower of Hanoi. The Five-Handed-Monster problem initially appeared to have more constraints, but I believe it's because the non-visual, non-tactile nature of the problem required the constraints to be spelled out verbally. After realizing this, I immediately tried to identify a subgoal ("Get the large globe to the large monster") because I knew this heuristic was useful for the Tower problem. Finally, as expected, my general strategy was one of means-end analysis. That is, I aimed to select operators that would reduce the difference between the state I was in and the end state.
