# The Serial Position Effect

## What is the serial position effect?

- The serial position effect - our tendency to have a better ability to retain information based on when/where it was presented in a group of similar information
  - This effect is believed to work for both STM and LTM
- Study by Rundus in 1971
  - List of 20 words, 5s apart

## How did you do?

- The primacy effect - the ability to better recall information contained at the beginning of a list
  - Linked to repetition
- The recency effect - the ability to better recall information contained at the end of a list
  - Linked to a lack of disruption and an increased ability to process information

## Applying this to life

- Right after you experience an event with a lot of information (movie, book, chapter, class, party, conversation, etc.) you tend to better recall information at the beginning and end of these events much better
- But do these effects hold for the long-term?

## A theory about STM and LTM

- Some people have proposed that the recency effect might be simply a result of STM storage--not an indication of LTM like the primacy effect is believed to be
  - Study by Postman and Philip in 1965
    - List of words + Game of 7s

### What these results imply

- The recency effect might be a byproduct of STM, not LTM
- This would suggest we can easily overestimate how much about an event we'll retain in the long run / after considerable time has passed
  - Atkinson's work on the overconfidence of retention (1971)
- It would also suggest that we should wait for some time before we estimate how much information we've retained from an experience
  - Rhodes and Tauber's 2011 summary of the literature - 30+ second benefit/test

## Before we celebrate the primacy effect

- It is important to note that there are studies that have shown the primacy effect can also be disrupted
  - Distraction tasks prior to presentation
  - Prevention of repetition during presentation
  - Stress for equal repetition during presentation (focusing on everything)
- This would suggest that the primacy effect is also not a long-term guarantee of increased retention

## Summing things up

- If not distracted and given the chance to quickly recall information after presentation, the serial position effect suggests that we can remember information presented at the beginning and end of an event better than the information in the middle
- If we *are* distracted or our memory is tested long after the information has been presented, our memory of the information is not nearly as improved by the serial position effect
- And of equal importance, we might not be able to accurately guess our future LTM retention of that information because of our boost in STM that comes from the serial position effect
