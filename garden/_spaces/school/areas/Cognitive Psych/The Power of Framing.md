# The Power of Framing

## Framing the framing topic

- discussing how we make decisions. focus is on decisions that require thought and risk, not ones that are based on preference
- large focus on the disconnect between what we should do and what we choose to do
  - normative model - model that describes what people should do
  - descriptive model - model that describes what people actually do

## Logical model #1: compensatory models

- Compensatory models are decision making devices that involve calculating out the positive and negative attributes of options in attempt to choose one
  - additive model - a strategy that adds attribute values to assign a score to each alternative
    - can involve multiple options
    - can even include weights for the value of options
  - additive-difference model - a strategy that compares two alternatives by adding the difference in their values for each attribute

## Logical model #2: noncompensatory models

- noncompensatory models are decision making devices that use the negative attributes of options in order to reduce the available options
  - elimination by aspects - evaluates one attribute at a time and rejects the options that fail to satisfy a minimum criterion
  - conjunctive model - evaluates options one at a time and rejects if the value of on of its attributes fails to satisfy a minimum criterion
- note: noncompensatory models can be used as both a means of selecting one option (satisficing search) or reducing the options available

## What if there are costs to consider?

- When there are potential costs and benefits to consider, the formula becomes more difficult
  - costs - what will be lost if one potential outcome occurs
  - gains - what will be acquired if one potential outcome occurs
  - expected value - the average value, as determined by combining the value of events with their probability of occurrence
    - this suggests that if EV is positive, we act, if negative, we don't

## So are we just computers?

- Utility - subjective value as determined by the decision maker
  - what do you value the most?
- subjective probability - an estimated probability as determined by the decision maker
  - what do you think the odds of that outcome occurring are?
- loss aversion - averse reaction to losses that outweighs the reaction to gains
  - 100 coin flips for $100, $1, 1Â¢

## framing / drug probability example

- the way that problems are introduced can also impact the decisions that we make
  - framing effect - we're more likely to take risks when loss is involved (we'll take the chance over the guarantee), and less likely to when gains are involved (we'll take the guarantee over chance)
  - this means that if your question focuses on the loss side of options, people will prefer risks. it also means that if your question focuses on the gain of options, people will prefer the certainty

## implications

- in decision making when we're presented with options, there are logical ways to approach them that can get you to a decision
- there are also some things that can impact these decisions that have nothing to do with logic
- knowing about both of these can make us better decision makers and be able to predict the decisions of others better
