# Heuristics vs Algorithms
## Defining the concepts
Algorithm
: a self-contained step-by-step process enacted when attempting to solve a problem

Heuristic
: a practical approach enacted when attempting to solve a problem

## Comparing the two

Algorithms are:
- Accurate (solutions should be obtained eventually)
- Straight-forward about how to follow
- Time-consuming and sometimes energy-intensive

Heuristics are:
- Easier to engage in and quick
- Prone to human error
- Based on experience

## Linking this to [[Types of Problems]]

Ways to solve a Rubik's Cube:
- Step-by-step approach?
  - Ex: Rotate one side 2 clicks, then the next side 1 click to eventually see all possible combinations and get the solution
- "Tricks" that could speed up the process?
  - Ex: Get one side to a single color first

Ways to solve the cannibal/missionary problem:
- Step-by-step approach?
- "Tricks" that could speed up the process?

## A common heuristic error example

The availability heuristic
: Our attempt to evaluate a topic based on the immediate examples that come to mind
- Which is more common in the English language, words that start with K or those that have K as the third letter?
  - The latter by 3x
- Are you more likely to be killed by a shark or by falling airplane parts?
  - Again, the latter

### Does this mean that heuristics are bad?

No, they just aren't perfect

- The option size impact
  - Revisiting the Rubik's Cube example
    - Algorithmically exploring the total possible combinations on the Cube is absurd
    - Heuristics can short cut this in a practical way
  - Letter scramble example
    - "eptuak"
    - You could algorithmically generate all possible combinations here as well
    - You could also apply certain (imperfect) heuristics
      - Does p _usually_ follow t or not?
      - Does p _usually_ follow k or not?

Knowing when to use one and when they can lead us astray are of critical importance.
