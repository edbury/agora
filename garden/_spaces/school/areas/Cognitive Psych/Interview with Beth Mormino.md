# Interview with Beth Mormino, Ph. D

Assignment: how does this relate to language?

Focused on the earliest changes in Alzheimer's before dementia sets in.
  - memory impairments specific to Alzheimer's vs aging
    - problems with encoding seem specific to early alzheimer's
    - recall strategies don't seem to help early Alzheimer's patients when compared to normal aging patients
  - other cognitive deficits?
    - starts with memory and spreads to other domains:
      - executive function
      - language
      - functional capabilities (farther down the line)

Atypical presentations:
- language or executive function deficits before memory
- associated with those regions of the brain being impaired before others

PET scans now allow us to get a pre-death Alzheimer's diagnosis!

secondary prevention 
: preventing symptoms in people that do have the disease by identifying and treating them early
