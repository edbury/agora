>Explain a recent situation where you or someone you were conversing with accidentally made a language error like the ones discussed in this module. Be specific about the example, and explain how it related to a concept or concepts in this moduleâ€™s material.

While ordering breakfast this morning, I asked the server if I could get "eggs on my cheese." My embarrassment was quickly overshadowed by my excitement at being able to name my speech error. I'm not sure my partner found the lengthy, unsolicited explanation *less* embarrassing, however.

This particular speech error was an exchange error, specifically a word exchange error. This case also fits the typical constraints of a word exchange error. That is, both words are members of the same syntactic category: nouns. I remain curious as to whether words adhering to the same morpheme structure are more likely than others to be subject to this type of error. For example, "Can I get eggs on my peppers?" would involve two words that are both syntactically (nouns) and morphemically (plurals) similar. 

As noted in the reading and lecture, the resulting sentence ("Can I get eggs on my cheese?") was grammatically correct, but highly unlikely ('impossible' even). The server and my partner both quickly untangled my intended meaning, despite the speech error. This is likely due to the bounty of context (linguistic and otherwise) available: I had just ordered the eggs themselves, substitutions are a typical part of the ordering script, cheese is a typical addition to eggs in the setting, etc.
