# Types of Problems

## Let's read the following passage - a problem solving example

Find the 3 digit number. Stop when you've utilized the minimum number of hints to solve.
- The difference of the last two digits is equal to 1.
- The product of the first and last digit is equal to 8.
- The sum of the first and last digit is equal to 6.
- The product of the first two digits is equal to 6.
- The sum of the first two digits is equal to 5.
- The difference of the first and last digits is equal to 2.

## What are we looking at?

> Solving a problem means finding a way out of a difficulty, a way around an obstacle, attaining an aim that was not immediately understandable. Solving problems is a specific gift of mankind: Solving problems can be regarded as the most characteristically human activity." - George Polya

- Note that (since this was stated) other species have been proven to solve problems as well

## Classifying problems

### Examples of problem types

Arrangement problems
: Problems that require rearranging parts to satisfy specified criterion

Induced-structure problems
: Problems that require finding a pattern among a fixed set of relations

Transformation problems
: Problems that require changing initial states through a sequence of operations to match a goal state

### Arrangement problems

Anagrams
: Rearranging a string of letters to form a word

Sentence structuring
: Reorganizing words to form a coherent sentence

Environment structuring
: Reorganizing stimuli to make work
  - The candle problem 

#### How do we solve these?
###### Overall Method of Accomplishment

Insight
: The sudden discovery of a solution following unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem

Gradual mastery
: A collection of small discoveries that build toward a final solution
- Metcalfe's 1986 confidence rating idea

###### Overcoming Obstacles

Unnecessary constraints (matchstick problems)

Functional fixedness
: The tendency to use an object in a specific way (only using the box of tacks to hold the tacks)

### Induced-structure problems

Series extrapolation
: Finding a pattern among a sequence of items to continue that pattern
- 1, 2, 3, 4, X
- 1, 4, 8, 16, X
- 18, 10, 6, 4, X
- 1, 5, 7, 16, X

Analogy problem
: A four-term problem that requires finding the answer that completes the relation

Progressive matrices test
: A collection of objects with a pattern of properties with one object missing, requiring you to identify the patterns in order to identify the missing object

#### How do we solve these?

Relations
: Nature of the connection between the objects of a pattern

###### Sternberg's theory (1977)

In sequence:

Encoding
: Identifying the attributes of the objects that could be important

Inference
: Establishing relationships between the first objects

Mapping
: Applying the relationship to the other objects

Application
: Determining the possible relationship from the successful mapping

### Transformation problems

- In transformation problems, the end is already known
- Transformation problems often incorporate a number of rules that need to be followed in the process
  - Missionaries and cannibals example (5 and 5, cannibals can never outnumber missionaries, must cross river to end state)

#### How do we solve these?

Means-end analysis
: A strategy that can be used by eliminating the differences between the initial and goal states

Sub-goals
: Steps that are known to be required to achieve/pass along the way
- Rubik's Cube example
- Note: not all sub-goals are helpful in transformation problems
