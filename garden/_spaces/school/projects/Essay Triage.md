# General Advice

I believe that the statements that truly distinguish themselves are those that demonstrate evidence of the potential to become an independent investigator. As a graduate student, you will be expected to progressively develop research skills that will establish you as an independent scholar. To the extent that it is possible to convey this within the personal statement, you may be able to make your potential to excel as a graduate student very clear to the reader.

As such, please critically reflect on the following questions and respond in no more than two (2) pages:

1.  Why does structural oppression exist? How has your understanding of this evolved over time?
2.  Why do you think it’s important to employ anti-racist practices and principles in social work? Give an example of a structural, institutional, or societal level change that social workers can advocate for that addresses systemic racism and white supremacy.
