# Schema Theories of Organization

[Reading the passage exercise]

## Explaining this effect

- Schemas - a knowledge structure that provides a framework for organizing clusters of information
  - schemas involve an interaction between the individual and new information
  - the learner takes past knowledge and applies it to new information
  - the learner also combines information into a whole, instead of looking at it as separate entities

## Theorists of this concept

### Piaget's Learning Theory

- Schemas are generated starting at a young age and can be used for a number of things:
  - default knowledge - knowledge of "most likely values" for the attributes of an object (stereotypes)
  - scripts - knowledge about what occurs during activities (steps)
  - connections - knowledge of associations between the attributes of (an) object(s)

### Bartlett's Schema Theory

- Instead of storing information in nodes, we organize it into "supernodes"
- Note: this does not reject the spreading activation theory, it just makes it a bit more complex
- Support?
  - Our access of schemas and answers to "yes/no" questions appear to be moderated by our sensory systems
    - Thinking of "Blue" and then being asked about the ocean
  - Autobiographical activation in the brain across several areas

## Take home message

- How we connect concepts to each other is a fairly complex act
- In all reality, similar to the topic of categorization, our mind probably uses several techniques to organize information within our head, not just one
