# Visual Images

>Mental imagery has long played a central role in psychologists' and philosophers' accounts of cognitive processes and the representation of knowledge in the mind. The construct of the image, however, has never been operationalized well enough to satisfy most psychologists, and so it is not surprising that imagery has disappeared periodically from the mainstream of Western psychology. Nevertheless, the concept has such magnetism that is has never stayed away for long, and it is currently enjoying remarkable popularity. - Stephen Kosslyn and James Pomerantz (1977)

verbal knowledge
: knowledge expressed in language

spatial knowledge
: knowledge of spatial relations that may be stored as images

## Visual imagery and learning

### Memory for pictures

### Paivio's dual-coding theory

concrete-abstract dimension
: extent to which a concept can be represented by a picture

imagery potential
: ease with which a concept can be imaged

association value
: the number of verbal associations generated for a concept

It is easy to form an image to represent a concrete object but difficult to form an image for an abstract concept.

Paivio (1969) argued that the concrete-abstract dimension is the most important determinant of ease in forming an image. 
- At the concrete end of the continuum are pictures, because the picture itself can be remembered as a visual image, and the person doesn't have to create an image.

High-imagery words are easier to learn than low-imagery words, but high-association words are not necessarily easier to learn than low-association words.

dual-coding theory
: a theory that memory is improved when items can be represented by both verbal and visual memory codes

The reason images are effective, according to Paivio (1975), is that an image provides a second kind of memory code that is independent of the verbal code. Paivio's theory is called dual-coding theory because it proposes two independent memory codes, either of which can result in recall.

relational information
: information specifying how concepts are related

A criticism of dual-coding theory is that it works only in situations in which people focus on relational information, such as the associations between items in a paired-associates task.

### Mnemonic strategies

keyword
: a concrete word that sounds like an abstract word so that it can be substituted for the abstract word in an interactive image

keyword method
: a mnemonic strategy using keywords to improve paired-associates learning

The keyword method divides the study of a vocabulary into two stages. The first stage is to associate the foreign word with an English keyword, which sounds approximately like some part of the foreign word. The second stage is to form a mental image of the keyword interacting with the English translation.
- For example, the Russian word for *building* (*zdanie*) is pronounced somewhat like *zdawnyeh*, with the emphasis on the first syllable. Using *dawn* as the keyword, one could imagine the pink light of dawn being reflected in the windows of a building.

## Evidence for images in performing cognitive tasks

Pylyshyn argued that it was misleading to think of images as uninterpreted photographs, analogous to pictures in the head. He supported the alternative view that an image is much closer to being a description of a scene than a picture of it. The emphasis on the descriptive characteristics of images, rather than their sensory characteristics, is the central theme of propositional theory.

propositional theory
: a theory that all knowledge, including spatial knowledge, can be expressed in semantic-based propositions

### Scanning visual images

visual scanning
: a shift of attention across a visual display or image

The analogy between pictures and images suggests that the time it takes to scan between two objects in an image should be a function of their distance from each other.

## Sequential versus parallel processing

One difference between information maintained in a visual image and information maintained as a verbal code is that a visual image makes it possible to match information in parallel.
- You can perceive many features of faces simultaneously. However, when you describe the same features verbally, you do not have access to all the features at the same time because language is sequential. 

parallel representation
: representation of knowledge in which more than one item at a time can be processed

sequential representation
: representation of knowledge in which only one item at a time can be processed

The parallel representation of spatial information and the sequential representation of verbal information influence how quickly a person can determine whether a perceived pattern matches a memorized pattern. If the memorized pattern is stored as a visual image, the match should occur quickly and should be relatively uninfluenced by the number of features that have to be matched. If a pattern is stored as a verbal description, the match should occur more slowly and should be influenced by the number of features that have to be compared.

### Mental transformations

### Interference

Duck/Rabbit study: In a subsequent study, Chambers and Reisberg (1992) examined why people had difficulty reinterpreting their image. They hypothesized that people maintain only the more important aspects of the image; in this case, the face of the animal.

People who had perceived the pattern as a duck now performed at chance level, whereas people who had perceived the pattern as a rabbit performed significantly better than chance. People therefore have difficulty reinterpreting the pattern because they are missing those details that are important for the new interpretation.

The fact that we lose some of the details in our images is partly the result of our failing to maintain a detailed image once we have a verbal code. People are more successful in reinterpreting an image of the duck/rabbit ambiguous figure if they are discouraged from forming a verbal code during the initial encoding of the figure.

Studies showing the limitation of visual images provide both good news and bad news. The bad news is that using visual images is not a universal solution for improving memory performance. The good news is that, even if people believe they have poor images, their images may still be sufficient for performing the many tasks that do not require great detail.

### Reality monitoring

People can remember information from two basic sources: external sources, derived from perception, and internal sources, derived from imagination or thought. The ability to distinguish between external and internal sources has been called reality monitoring by Johnson and Raye.

reality monitoring
: discriminating between actual and imagined events

Johnson and her colleagues’ findings show that, although the number of image trials did influence subjects’ judgments of presentation frequency, their judgments were nonetheless fairly accurate. In general, people are able to remember the origin of information (internal vs external) remarkably well.

Johnson and Raye (1981) have proposed that several kinds of cues are helpful. First, there is sensory information. Perceptual events have more spatial detail than imagined events, although the amount of sensory information varies among individuals, as shown by the difference between good and poor imagers. 

Second, there is contextual information. Perceptual events occur in an external context that contains other information. We have seen in previous chapters that contextual information is important in recalling material, and it is also important in helping us distinguish whether an event was internally or externally generated.

A third cue for making this distinction is memory for the cognitive operations that are required to generate the image. If we can generate an image automatically without much conscious awareness, we will have poor memory of the cognitive operations used to generate the image.
- Dreams that occur during sleep are of this type. They often seem very real because we are not aware of generating them. In contrast, daydreams seem much less real because they are more influenced by our conscious control.

### Breakdown of reality monitoring

>Although it may be disconcerting to contemplate, true and false memories arise in the same way. Memories are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context (Johnson, 2006, p. 760).

Lindsay and Read (1994) indicate that memory research has identified a number of factors that increase the possibility of creating false memories. These include long delays between the event and the attempt to remember, repeated suggestions that the event occurred, the perceived authority of the source of the suggestions, the perceived plausibility of the suggestions, mental rehearsal of the imagined event, and the use of hypnosis or guided imagery.

: imagined event or image believed to be real

## Summary

The dual-coding theory explains the usefulness of visual imagery in recall by proposing that a visual image provides an extra memory code that is independent of the verbal code.

Visual images also make it possible to compare all the features of two patterns simultaneously when we try to match a visual pattern with an image of another pattern. In contrast, features described verbally must be compared one at a time because of the sequential nature of language.

The lack of memory for details is caused by focusing on only the most important details, but encouraging people to rely on images increases their ability to use them. 

An advantage of the lack of detailed sensory information in images is that it helps us distinguish between perceived and imagined events (reality monitoring).
