>Provide a detailed description of 4 different tools that you'll use for the remainder of this class in order to take advantage of the memory code information covered in this module. Be sure to refer to each effect that you're referencing by name, use at least two applicable topics in your plan, and provide a clear description of why each approach will help. Don't forget that these approaches must apply to the information from this module.

# Memory Tools

At the highest level, the levels-of-processing model offers a lever for improving recall, referred to as "deep" processing. Four related expansions on the model provide more direct guidance: elaboration, distinction, encoding specificity, and transfer-appropriate processing.

## The Elaboration Hypothesis

Anderson and Reder propose that additional associations are stored alongside the information we are attempting to learn. In addition, we have learned to more easily create semantic associations as a form of elaboration compared to structural or phonemic associations. The elaboration hypothesis claims that more elaborate codes will be easier to recall when needed.

The most direct route to creating semantic elaboration is to generate more elaborate contexts for the information I'm trying to learn. Specifically, I should utilize precise elaboration and ensure that the additional material is relevant to the information being learned. The fat man / thin ice sentence frame is a great example of this but doesn't necessarily pertain to an in-class use case. 

A simple application in my notes might look like this:
- Zero elaboration - "phonemic coding"
- Imprecise elaboration - "Phonemic coding is a memory code mentioned in Chapter 6."
- Precise elaboration - "Phonemic coding is a memory code emphasizing auditory/verbal aspect likes pronunciation."

The first example includes zero context. It's both highly unlikely and unhelpful. The imprecise elaboration offers additional, true context; however, the material isn't necessarily relevant to the meaning of "phonemic coding." The precise elaboration includes associations that enhance the meaning of the information I'm trying to remember: phonemic coding is related to pronunciation or, perhaps obviously, phonemes.

## Distinctiveness

The distinctiveness hypothesis proposes that it is easier to recall more distinct memory codes. Part of the rationale for distinctiveness is that more distinct items are less likely to interfere with other items in memory. This would help to avoid things like consonant confusion mentioned in the previous chapter. The text presents several aspects of distinctiveness that can be useful for an academic setting.

Primary distinctiveness, an item or event being distinct from others in its immediate context, can improve recall by providing a release from proactive interference. For example, I can make the information presented in the chapter more distinct if I break up my readings rather than consuming the text all at once.

Secondary distinctiveness, items being distinct from others stored in LTM, seems more difficult to achieve intentionally. For example, I don't have control over the orthographic distinctiveness of the relevant words I'm attempting to learn. It's possible that elaboration could help a non-distinct item seem more distinct, but this isn't mentioned specifically.

Processing distinctiveness, however, should be easier to achieve because I have more control over the strategies I employ when trying to encode and store information. As with elaboration above, semantic distinction has a more powerful effect than structural or phonemic distinction. Under this lens, strategies like mind maps or concept grouping would be more beneficial than simply rereading the chapter because they involve semantic ("deep") processing rather than rote rehearsal. 

## Encoding Specificity

The encoding specificity principle proposes that information is easier to recall when the retrieval cue (and context) relate to the encoding of that memory. In short, like attracts like; for example, semantically encoded information is more easily retrieved when utilizing semantic cues. Outside of the experimental setting, this applies more generally. 

Mood-dependent memory is one example of a more general cue. The claim here is that memory performs better if our mood during recall matches our mood during encoding. This is why it's so easy to remember all the other times we were angry with our partner in the middle of an argument. While this class doesn't usually stir up strong feelings of anger, shifts in mood are a natural part of living. 

One strategy I can employ based on this knowledge relates to mindfulness. Because this is a remote class, I am able to decide when I study and when I complete assignments. I can take stock of how I am feeling at those times and make a decision about whether or not my mood is suitable for the task. If I'm angry or upset, I shouldn't sit down to study unless I plan on being angry or upset while completing assignments. Alternatively, I could attempt to make myself consistently angry while studying and completing work, but that seems rather unpleasant.

Another strategy applies to the contexts for those tasks. Because we're remote, I typically don't have to worry about the setting of my studying or test-taking. Instead, I can ensure that I am in my office under near-identical conditions while both encoding the information (as I read and study) and retrieving that information (while writing or test-taking).

## Transfer-Appropriate Processing

Transfer-appropriate processing proposes that we should seek to create memory codes related to how we will eventually use the material. Regarding academic work, this means that different learning strategies are suitable for different goals. For example, if we were being tested on the pronunciation of psychologists' names, only attending to semantic information and not phonemic information would be a problem.

While I understand the theory behind transfer-appropriate processing, I find myself struggling with constructing a single strategy to employ it. Perhaps that is the point, at least as it relates to application in this class.

Research Methodology, for example, consisted almost entirely of multiple-choice and short-answer tests. That meant that knowledge of the details was more important than conceptual organization because I didn't have to write any essays, for example. When I was a graduate student in philosophy, I experienced the opposite.

In this class, we approach the material from multiple angles, which suggests multiple appropriate strategies, depending on the assignment. This assignment, for example, would benefit from problem-oriented acquisition. Since I had this prompt when beginning the module, I was able to frame some of my encodings ahead of time, "How might this help me solve a problem later?" However, I know that this material will also be tested in a multiple-choice format in the next module's quiz and during the final. For those cases, fact-oriented acquisition would be more suitable (as above). 

In short, it's best to tailor your learning strategy to the types of assignments that will test recall of that information. 

## Additional Notes

It should be noted that all of these strategies show some overlap. 

Semantic encoding tends to outperform phonemic and structural encoding as long as the other guidelines are followed. For example, phonemic encoding is more easily retrieved by phonemic cues, but semantic encoding retrieved by semantic cues typically has an even higher success rate.

Similarly, emotional states affect both distinctiveness of codes and encoding specificity.
