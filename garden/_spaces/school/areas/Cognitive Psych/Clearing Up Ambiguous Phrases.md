# Clearing Up Ambiguous Phrases

## Making language complex

Transformational grammar
: a set of rules for transforming a sentence into a related sentence
- "The dog bit the boy." and "The boy was bit by the dog."

Impossible sentences
: sentences that obey grammatical rules, but don't make sense
- "The horseshoe slept before the sky."

Ambiguous sentences
: sentences that can have multiple meanings
- "They are flying planes."
- "Tryouts for wrestling cheerleaders"

## Clearing up confusion

Surface structure
: the actual structure of a spoken sentence
- syntax

Deep structure
: the underlying meaning of a sentence
- semantics

Note: both ideas (Chomsky, 1965) brought us to understand the importance of psycholinguistics

psycholinguistics
: the psychology of language

## Using syntax and semantics

We assess the meaning of words and their properties (e.g., inanimate objects versus animate objects), while also assessing proper structure in order to understand how the words can fit in a coherent manner
- "The defendant examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable."
- "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable."
- The second sentence is easier/faster to parse because it fits the familiar schema better

We also assess the meaning of neighboring sentences and words to detect meaning of sentences AND words
- "The boy was confused about what he was seeing in the sky until his dad told him, 'They are flying planes.'"
- "I was so mad that I told him I needed space." versus "The shuttle prepared for its most recent space launch."

We can also use semantics to detect the meaning of sentences when syntax is not properly followed.
- "John ran for the store fastly for milk before it closed."

## Prove it!

Word superiority effect
: the finding that letters in words are easier to identify than letters in non-words or letters alone even in short time spans
- BACK -> XAXX ("the second letter" is located more quickly than below)
- CAKB -> XAXX

Sentence superiority effect
: the idea that processing words is easier when they are part of a sentence
- "Bank"
- "The bank ran out of money"

### What about truly ambiguous words?

- Option 1: access all of the known meanings if no information if provided
- Option 2: access only the most probable word if no information is provided
- Option 3: access the most "available" word if no information is provided

### Which one is it?

Lexical decision tasks
: deciding if something is a word in sentences (Schwanenflugel and Shoben, 1985)

High-constraint sentences
: sentences that produce a high expectation for a particular word based on the topic
- "The dog ate his bone" versus "The dog ate his bean"

Low-constraint sentences
: sentences that produce a greater expectation for a particular word based on probability
- "The lady was an excellent cook" versus "The lady was an excellent chef"

Longer delays in the high-constraint, unexpected words ("bean")

### Other proof?

["kuh" phoneme exercise]

Swinney and Hakes sentences on ambiguity:
- Rumor had it that, for years, the government building had been plagued with problems. The man was not surprised when he found several bugs in the corner of his room.
- Rumor had it that, for years, the government building had been plagued with problems. The man was not surprised when he found several spiders, roaches, and other bugs in the corner of his room.

The fact that the second one requires less time to identify the "kuh" indicates that the importance of the semantics cannot be understated.

## Interesting individual differences

### Skilled reader exceptions

Suppression skills
: ability to eliminate inappropriate meaning in a sentence

Working memory capacity
: ability to retain information in order to detect the context (semantics) of a sentence or word

Error recovery heuristics
: ability to incorporate strategies for correcting comprehension errors

## In closing

Though language appears to be a random cognitive task on the surface, the complexity of this activity makes the study of language comprehension and production very challenging.
