# Manipulating Long-Term Memory

## Common assumptions about LTM

- Long-term memory is:
  - A collection of information that you have deemed important enough to store forever--or at least a long time
  - Infinite
  - Extremely detailed compared to STM
  - Difficult to alter
  - All housed in one area of the brain

## Which ones can we verify?

- Research has suggested that long-term memories do last a long time--though accessing them might become difficult
  - The neural path model that explains "forgetting"
- There are no indications that you have a limited capacity in your LTM
  - Dispelling the "Kelly Bundy Effect" (term prof made up)
- LTM does seem to have the potential to be very detailed
  - Research on flash-bulb memories
  - Impacts of discussion and memory techniques on recall amounts

## Which ones can we not verify?
- Our brain has several areas that house memories
  - Explicit - memories that we can verbally recall
    - The hippocampus (the medial temporal lobe)
  - Implicit - memories that are displayed through some type of non-verbal response (moving, speeds of responses, emotions evoked, etc)
    - The motor cortex, amygdala, cerebellum, and the reflex pathways of the lower cortical areas of the brain

## And the accuracy of LTM?

- The overconfidence barrier - the fact that we often have too much confidence in our judgments
  - This has been applied to memory accuracy as well
  - It has even been applied to flashbulb memories
- But why is our LTM so inaccurate?
  - Original issues during encoding
  - Alterations of information during storage
  - Manipulation of the information during the recall process

### Encoding difficulty

- Inattentional blindness - the inability to completely process an event unless our attention is focused on that event
  - Mack and Rock, 1992
- Selective perception - our tendency to manipulate our perception of experience based on our expectations of what we _should_ experience
  - This has been tied to schemas (Bartlett, 1932) to explain differences in opinion about events and details of those events

### Storage alterations

- The impact of decay of information over time
- The role of reconstructive processing in memory
  - Bedtime word list
  - The importance of familiarity and organization
  - Linking this to the hindsight bias
  - There are questions about whether or not this effect is most prominent in the encoding, storage, or retrieval stage

### Recall manipulations

- The importance of cues and schemas
  - Comparing the a) library metaphor, b) memory as reproduction, and c) memory as a narrative models
  - The War of the Ghosts example
- The impact of leading questions
  - Elizabeth Loftus's work
    - The "Accident" experiment and misleading questions
    - The "Mall" experiment

## What's the point?

- Though our LTM is pretty amazing, it's certainly not infallible
- It can easily be manipulated at several points along the way
- Because of this, our LTM is never really a recreation of an event or experience
- So appreciate your LTM, but recognize its limitations
